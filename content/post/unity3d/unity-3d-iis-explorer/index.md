# Unity 3D ISS Explorer

did this a few years ago as a proof of concept for a project i was proposing.

Unity has the ablity to compile time target \ publish to the web (using [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly)) tricks), unfortunately the models end up blowing up the memory on this project..

I have a todo to go back to the code and tweak it so I could run it in a web player someday...
