# In-Depth Understanding of State Interpolation & Prediction in Cloud Multiplayer Games
-->

## Introduction

In cloud-based multiplayer games, **network latency** is one of the biggest challenges.

Players expect **smooth movement**, but real-time communication between the **server** and **clients** comes with annoying delays.

To address this,  **State Interpolation & Prediction** algorithms are used to create a **smoother** multiplayer experience.

### What We Will Discuss:

* The fundamentals of **network lag** and **latency compensation**
* **State Interpolation**: How it smooths out movement in laggy environments
* **State Prediction**: How it reduces perceived lag
* The differences between **server-authoritative** and **client-side prediction**
* How to implement these concepts in **Unity with Photon**

<!-- 
By the end, you'll have a deep understanding of **how to make movement in multiplayer games feel buttery smooth!** üéÆ
-->

***

## Understanding Network Latency in Multiplayer Games

### 1. The Problem: Lag and Delay

When a player moves, their action must be **sent to the server** and then **distributed to all other players**. This introduces:

* **Ping Delay**: The time it takes for a packet to travel between a client and the server.
* **Packet Loss**: When packets fail to reach their destination, causing stutter.
* **Out-of-Order Packets**: Network congestion can cause packets to arrive **out of order**, leading to jerky motion.

We need **State Interpolation & Prediction** to counteract these issues. üöÄ

***

## What is State Interpolation?

### **How It Works**

**State Interpolation** smooths movement by buffering past positions and rendering them **slightly behind real-time**.

1. **Buffer Incoming Updates** üì¶
   * Instead of immediately updating a character‚Äôs position when data is received, we **store past positions** in a buffer.

2. **Render Slightly Behind Real Time** üï∞Ô∏è
   * Instead of showing the latest received position, we render the character **a few milliseconds behind**.

3. **Use Linear Interpolation** üìä
   * When a new position update arrives, we use **lerp (linear interpolation)** to transition between the two latest positions.

### **Example Code: Interpolating Player Movement**

```csharp
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine;

public class StateInterpolation : MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
    private Vector3 lastReceivedPosition;
    private Vector3 previousPosition;
    private float interpolationTime = 0.1f;

    void Update()
    {
        if (!photonView.IsMine)
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(previousPosition, lastReceivedPosition, interpolationTime);
        }
    }

    public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
    {
        if (stream.IsWriting)
        {
            stream.SendNext(transform.position);
        }
        else
        {
            previousPosition = lastReceivedPosition;
            lastReceivedPosition = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
        }
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros:**

* Smooths out minor network fluctuations.
* Works well for games where precise real-time action isn‚Äôt required (e.g., MMOs, RTS games).

üî¥ **Cons:**

* Adds a **small input delay** (~100-200ms) to ensure smoothness.
* Doesn‚Äôt work well for **fast-paced FPS or racing games**.

***

## What is State Prediction?

### **How It Works**

Instead of waiting for server updates, **State Prediction** **predicts** where the player will be based on **input and movement physics**.

1. **Process Input Locally First** üéÆ
   * The client processes player input **immediately** rather than waiting for server confirmation.

2. **Send Data to the Server** üì°
   * The predicted movement is sent to the server, but the client doesn‚Äôt wait for validation.

3. **Server Reconciliation** üîÑ
   * If the server detects a discrepancy, it corrects the player‚Äôs position.

### **Example Code: Predicting Player Movement**

```csharp
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine;

public class StatePrediction : MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
    private Vector3 predictedPosition;
    private Vector3 lastServerPosition;

    void Update()
    {
        if (photonView.IsMine)
        {
            float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * 5f;
            float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * 5f;
            predictedPosition += new Vector3(moveX, 0, moveZ);
            transform.position = predictedPosition;
        }
        else
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, lastServerPosition, 0.1f);
        }
    }

    public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
    {
        if (stream.IsWriting)
        {
            stream.SendNext(predictedPosition);
        }
        else
        {
            lastServerPosition = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
        }
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros:**

* Eliminates perceived lag for local players.
* Essential for fast-paced games like FPS and racing games.

üî¥ **Cons:**

* **More complex to implement**.
* May cause "rubber-banding" if reconciliation isn‚Äôt handled well.

## Interpolation vs. Prediction: Which One to Use?

| Feature                   | State Interpolation | State Prediction |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Smoothness                | ‚úÖ Very smooth       | ‚ö†Ô∏è May be jerky  |
| Input Delay               | ‚ö†Ô∏è Small Delay      | ‚úÖ No Delay       |
| Fast-paced Games          | ‚ùå Not Ideal         | ‚úÖ Best Choice    |
| Implementation Complexity | ‚úÖ Easy              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder        |

### **Key Ideas**

* **Use Interpolation** for slower-paced games (RPGs, strategy, open-world games).
* **Use Prediction** for fast-paced competitive games (FPS, racing, fighting games).
* **Hybrid Approach**: Many AAA games use a combination of both!

‚úÖ **How they smooth out lag** üì°

**NOTE**\
Unity3d is very versatile and can target many platforms. All the techniques here apply to iPhone-iOS, Android , as well as Windows and Mac.

Unity3d has the ability to target web pages- by compiling to web assembly. BUT the caveat is when you are running on a web page, your code can talk back to the server it came from , but cannot make calls out to other domains (cross origin issues).
