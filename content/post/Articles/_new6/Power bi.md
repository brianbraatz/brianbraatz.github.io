# Power BI vs Looker: A Comprehensive Comparison of Business Intelligence Tools
-->

## Introduction

Business Intelligence (BI) tools have **transformed** how companies **analyze and visualize data**.

Two of the biggest names in this space are **Power BI** (from Microsoft) and **Looker** (from Google).

But which one is **better**? Well, that **depends** on your use case.

This article will break down:

* **How BI tools worked before Power BI & Looker.**
* **The history and evolution of each tool.**
* **Their pros, cons, and key differences.**
* **How they compare in performance, complexity, and alternative BI solutions.**

By the end, youâ€™ll have a clear **understanding** of which BI tool fits your needs.

***

## What Came Before Power BI and Looker?

Before modern BI tools, **data analysis was painful**.

### **Traditional BI Methods**

1. **Excel & Spreadsheets** â†’ Small-scale analysis, limited automation.
2. **SQL Queries & Reporting** â†’ Developers manually wrote queries for insights.
3. **Custom Dashboards** â†’ Built using Python, R, or JavaScript, requiring engineering effort.

These approaches **lacked automation**, were **hard to scale**, and often required **manual updates**.

Then, **self-service BI tools** like **Power BI and Looker** emerged, revolutionizing **data visualization and analytics**.

***

## The History of Power BI & Looker

### **Power BI: Microsoftâ€™s Answer to Self-Service BI**

* **Launched:** 2015 by Microsoft.
* **Built on Excelâ€™s Power Pivot & SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).**
* **Quickly became the most used BI tool globally.**

### **Looker: Googleâ€™s Data-First BI Tool**

* **Founded in 2012, acquired by Google in 2020.**
* **Uses LookML (a modeling language for defining business metrics).**
* **Designed for cloud-native, SQL-based analytics.**
