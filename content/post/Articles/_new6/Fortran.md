# The Fortran Programming Language: History, Motivation, Relationship to Modern Languages, and 10 Code Examples
-->

## Introduction

Before Python, before C, before even Lisp, there was **Fortran**.

Yes, this is **one of the oldest programming languages still in use today**. Developed in the **1950s**, Fortran (short for **Formula Translation**) was created to handle **scientific and engineering computations**â€”and it still does that job better than many modern languages.,

<!-- 
This article will explore:  

- The **history and motivation** behind Fortran.  
- How it influenced **modern programming languages**.  
- **10 real code examples** of Fortran in action.  
- A **table of Fortran syntax** compared to modern languages.

## The History of Fortran

Fortran was born at **IBM in 1957**, thanks to **John Backus and his team**. At the time, programming was done in **assembly language**, which made writing complex calculations **painfully slow and error-prone**.

### **Why Was Fortran Created?**

* Scientists and engineers needed a way to **write mathematical formulas in a human-readable way**.
* Computers were getting more powerful, but programming them was still a **nightmare**.
* **IBM wanted to make programming easier**, and Fortran was their solution.

### **Key Innovations of Fortran**

âœ… **First High-Level Language** â†’ Before Fortran, everything was hand-coded in assembly.\
âœ… **First Compiler** â†’ The original Fortran compiler was one of the first optimizing compilers ever built.\
âœ… **Built for Scientific Computing** â†’ Fortran was **designed from day one for numerical computations**.\
âœ… **Still in Use Today** â†’ Modern Fortran (Fortran 90, 95, 2003, 2018) is used in **climate modeling, physics, and engineering simulations**.

## Fortranâ€™s Influence on Modern Languages

| Feature                                       | Fortran | Modern Equivalent               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Mathematical Computations**                 | âœ… Yes   | âœ… Python (NumPy), Julia, MATLAB |
| **Compiled Language**                         | âœ… Yes   | âœ… C, C++                        |
| **High Performance**                          | âœ… Yes   | âœ… Rust, C++                     |
| **Array Processing**                          | âœ… Yes   | âœ… Python (NumPy), R             |
| **Structured Programming (Introduced later)** | âœ… Yes   | âœ… C, Java, Python               |

ðŸ’¡ **Verdict:** Fortran is still **one of the best languages for high-performance scientific computing**!

## Fortran Syntax Table

| Concept                                | Fortran Code                                        | Equivalent in Python / C                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hello World**                        | `PRINT *, "Hello, World!"`                          | `print("Hello, World!")` / `printf("Hello, World!");`                 |
| **Variables**                          | `INTEGER :: x = 42`                                 | `x = 42` / `int x = 42;`                                              |
| **Loops**                              | `DO i = 1, 10` followed by `END DO`                 | `for i in range(1, 11):` / `for (int i=1; i<=10; i++)`                |
| **Conditionals**                       | `IF (x > 5) THEN PRINT *, "High"`                   | `if x > 5: print('High')` / `if (x > 5) { printf("High"); }`          |
| **Functions**                          | `FUNCTION square(x) RESULT(y) y = x*x END FUNCTION` | `def square(x): return x * x` / `int square(int x) { return x * x; }` |
| **Arrays**                             | `INTEGER, DIMENSION(5) :: A = (/1,2,3,4,5/)`        | `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`                                                 |
| **Modules (Introduced in Fortran 90)** | `MODULE math_functions`                             | `import math`                                                         |
