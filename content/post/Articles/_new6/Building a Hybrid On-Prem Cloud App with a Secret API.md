# Experience Building a Hybrid On-Premise Cloud Application, and How to Do It with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

## Introduction

**Hybrid cloud architecture** is one of those things that **sounds fancy**, but in reality, it's just a **way to mix on-premise computing with cloud services**.

There are many reasons to **not put everything in the cloud**, and I once had a **real-world use case** for this.

> **The Problem:** Our algorithms were **highly sensitive**, and we didn't want to put **even the compiled code on a cloud VM**. The best solution? **Keep our algorithm running on-premise while using the cloud for everything else**.

This article will show **how to build a similar hybrid cloud setup** using the latest features in **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud**.

***

## What is a Hybrid Cloud?

A **hybrid cloud** is an **IT architecture** where some workloads run **on-premise** (your own servers) while others run in **the public cloud** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

‚úÖ **Why Use a Hybrid Cloud?**

* **Security** ‚Äì Keep sensitive data/code on-prem.
* **Performance** ‚Äì Keep high-speed processing local.
* **Cost Savings** ‚Äì Reduce cloud costs for predictable workloads.
* **Compliance** ‚Äì Some industries have **regulations** requiring on-premise storage.

### **How I Built a Hybrid Cloud Before Modern Cloud Services**

Back in the day, I **built a hybrid cloud system** using an **early version of Azure**. It worked, but it was **painful**:

* We had **a secret algorithm** running **on a local server in our office**.
* Our cloud-based app **called the on-premise server via a VPN**.
* We **manually managed connections**.

Now, let's **do this properly** with modern **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud**.

***

## The Hybrid Cloud Architecture

üí° **Use Case:** We will build a **super-secret microservice** that **divides two numbers** (yeah, real spy stuff üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

üìå **How it works:**

1. The **secret division algorithm** runs **on-premise** (Python & C# microservices).
2. A **public cloud microservice (AWS/Azure/GCP)** acts as a **proxy API**.
3. The cloud **forwards API requests** to the on-premise service.

### **Architecture Diagram**

## Step 1: Write the Super-Secret Microservice (Python & C#)

### **Python Version** (Runs On-Prem)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/divide', methods=['POST'])
def divide():
    data = request.json
    try:
        result = data['a'] / data['b']
        return jsonify({"result": result})
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return jsonify({"error": "Division by zero!"}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

### **C# Version** (Runs On-Prem)

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class DivideController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Divide([FromBody] DivisionRequest request)
    {
        if (request.B == 0)
            return BadRequest("Division by zero!");

        return Ok(new { result = request.A / request.B });
    }
}

public class DivisionRequest
{
    public double A { get; set; }
    public double B { get; set; }
}
```

***

## Step 2: Deploy the Microservice in Docker (On-Prem)

Create a **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py .
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build and Run:

```sh
docker build -t secret-division .
docker run -p 5001:5001 secret-division
```

Now, we have **our secret microservice running under my desk**.

***

## Step 3: Build the Cloud Proxy Microservice

### **Cloud Proxy Service (Python Flask)**

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
ON_PREM_SERVICE = "http://my-office-server:5001/divide"

@app.route('/divide', methods=['POST'])
def proxy_divide():
    data = request.json
    response = requests.post(ON_PREM_SERVICE, json=data)
    return response.json(), response.status_code

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

***

## Step 4: Deploy the Proxy Service in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

### **AWS: Use Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda + API Gateway**

4. Deploy the proxy microservice using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
5. Set up **AWS API Gateway** to expose it publicly.
6. Configure **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** to connect to the on-prem service.

### **Azure: Use Azure App Service + VPN Gateway**

7. Deploy the proxy microservice to **Azure App Service**.
8. Use **Azure API Management** to expose it.
9. Configure **Azure VPN Gateway** to reach the on-prem service.

### **Google Cloud: Use Cloud Run + Hybrid Connectivity**

10. Deploy the proxy to **Google Cloud Run**.
11. Expose it via **Google API Gateway**.
12. Use **Google Cloud Interconnect** to talk to on-prem services.

***

## Key Takeaways

* **Hybrid Cloud = Best of Both Worlds** ‚Üí Security + Cloud Benefits.
* **We kept our sensitive division algorithm on-prem while using cloud for API proxying.**
* **Modern hybrid cloud solutions** (AWS VPN, Azure Hybrid Cloud, Google Interconnect) make this easy.
