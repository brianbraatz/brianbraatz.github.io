# How We Used to Scale Websites and App Services: A Deep Dive into Pre-Cloud Scaling Methods
-->

## Introduction

Before **cloud computing, Kubernetes, and serverless architectures**, scaling websites and app services was a **painful, expensive, and highly manual** process.

Developers and system administrators had to **plan for traffic spikes**, manually configure servers, and hope their infrastructure could handle **unexpected surges**.

<!--
In this article, we'll explore:  

- **How scaling worked before cloud-native solutions.**  
- **The three major pre-cloud scaling techniques (monolithic, load balancing, and VMs).**  
- **Examples of how businesses scaled their applications.**  
- **The pros, cons, and limitations of each method.**  

By the end, you'll appreciate just **how much cloud services changed everything**.  
-->

***

## Before Cloud Scaling: The Three Main Approaches

Before containerization and **auto-scaling cloud services**, applications were scaled using:

1. **Monolithic Scaling (Vertical Scaling)** â€“ Adding more **CPU, RAM, and storage** to a single large server.
2. **Multiple Server Deployment (Load Balancers)** â€“ Running **multiple app instances** on different servers with a load balancer.
3. **Virtual Machines (VMs) with Auto-Scaling** â€“ Deploying applications across **virtual machines** with automated scaling policies.

Let's break each of these down in detail.

***

## 1. Monolithic Scaling (Vertical Scaling)

### **How It Worked**

* Applications were deployed on **a single powerful server**.
* When demand increased, **CPU, RAM, and storage** were upgraded.
* Everythingâ€”**database, backend, and frontend**â€”ran on the same machine.

### **Example Setup**

Imagine an e-commerce website in **2005** running on a **dedicated Linux server** with:

* **2 CPU cores**
* **4GB RAM**
* **Single MySQL database**
* **Apache HTTP server**

If traffic increased, the team **upgraded the server** to:

* **4 CPU cores**
* **16GB RAM**
* **Faster SSD storage**

ðŸ’¡ **This is called "scaling up" or "vertical scaling."**

### **Pros and Cons of Vertical Scaling**

| Feature         | Pros                      | Cons                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplicity**  | Easy to set up and manage | Limited by hardware constraints                       |
| **Performance** | Works well for small apps | No redundancyâ€”if the server fails, everything is down |
| **Cost**        | Initially cheap           | Gets expensive as hardware upgrades increase          |

ðŸ’¡ **Verdict:** **Best for small, single-server applications, but bad for handling sudden traffic spikes.**

***

## 2. Multiple Server Deployment (Load Balancers)

### **How It Worked**

* Instead of **one big server**, companies ran **multiple smaller servers**.
* A **load balancer** distributed requests among these servers.
* If traffic increased, more servers were **manually** added.

### **Example Setup**

A **social media site in 2010** with **high traffic** might have used:

* **3 application servers running PHP & MySQL**
* **1 Nginx load balancer distributing requests**
* **Shared database on a separate server**

If demand increased, admins **added more app servers manually**.

### **Pros and Cons of Load Balancers**

| Feature         | Pros                                     | Cons                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability** | Can handle large traffic                 | Adding new servers was manual                  |
| **Redundancy**  | One server failure doesn't crash the app | Load balancer can be a single point of failure |
| **Performance** | Spreads traffic across multiple nodes    | Complex configuration                          |

ðŸ’¡ **Verdict:** **A major improvement over vertical scaling, but required manual intervention and constant monitoring.**

***

## 3. Virtual Machines (VMs) with Auto-Scaling

### **How It Worked**

* Instead of **physical servers**, businesses used **virtual machines**.
* VMs ran on a **hypervisor (like VMware, Xen, or KVM)**.
* **Auto-scaling policies** spun up more VMs **dynamically** when traffic increased.

### **Example Setup**

A **news website in 2015** using auto-scaling VMs might have:

* **Amazon EC2 instances (AWS)** hosting the application.
* **Auto-Scaling Groups (ASG) increasing instances** during peak hours.
* **Cloud Load Balancer distributing traffic dynamically**.

If **traffic spiked**, AWS **automatically** created new VMs.

### **Pros and Cons of Virtual Machines with Auto-Scaling**

| Feature             | Pros                             | Cons                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**      | Auto-scaling reduces manual work | Still slower than container-based scaling |
| **Flexibility**     | Can run on-prem or in the cloud  | More complex than load balancing alone    |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Only pay for what you use        | Requires cloud-based infrastructure       |

ðŸ’¡ **Verdict:** **The closest thing to modern cloud-native scaling, but still required managing VMs, operating systems, and dependencies.**

***

## Comparing the Three Pre-Cloud Scaling Methods

| Feature         | Vertical Scaling      | Load Balancers    | VMs with Auto-Scaling     |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Best For**    | Small apps            | Medium apps       | Large, cloud-based apps   |
| **Scalability** | Limited               | Manual scaling    | Automatic scaling         |
| **Redundancy**  | No                    | Yes               | Yes                       |
| **Cost**        | High for large setups | Moderate          | Pay-as-you-go             |
| **Performance** | Single server limit   | Balanced requests | Cloud-native auto-scaling |

ðŸ’¡ **Summary:**

* **Vertical scaling was simple** but **not scalable beyond a single machine**.
* **Load balancers improved scalability** but **still required manual intervention**.
* **VMs with auto-scaling introduced cloud efficiency** but **weren't as flexible as containers**.

***

## Why Cloud & Containers Changed Everything

With **cloud computing, Kubernetes, and Docker**, businesses no longer:

âœ… Need **manual intervention to scale**.\
âœ… Waste money on **idle, pre-provisioned servers**.\
âœ… Have **long deployment cycles** when adding new capacity.

Instead, **modern applications use Kubernetes and cloud-native scaling**, allowing **instant auto-scaling, self-healing deployments, and cost optimization**.

## Key Takeaways

* **Scaling before cloud computing was difficult and expensive.**
* **Vertical scaling worked for small applications but had hard limits.**
* **Load balancing helped distribute traffic but required manual intervention.**
* **VMs with auto-scaling were the first step toward cloud-native scaling.**
* **Cloud computing and containerization removed manual scaling issues.**
