   * Select the runtime as **Node.js** or your preferred language.
   * Leave the permissions as is (or create a new role if needed).
   * Click **Create function**.

#### 2. **Write Lambda Function Code**

After creating the function, you’ll see a default editor. Replace the code with the following simple example:

javascript

CopyEdit

`exports.handler = async (event) => {     const response = {         statusCode: 200,         body: JSON.stringify('Hello, World!'),     };     return response; };`

This function simply returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World!".

#### 3. **Set Up API Gateway to Trigger Lambda**

1. **Navigate to API Gateway:**

   * Go to **API Gateway** from the AWS Management Console.
2. **Create a New API:**

   * Choose **Create API** and select **HTTP API**.

   * Select the Lambda function you created earlier (`HelloWorldFunction`).
4. **Deploy API:**

   * Click on **Deployments** in the API Gateway console.
   * Create a new stage (e.g., `prod`) and deploy the API.
5. **Invoke the API:**

   * After deployment, you’ll receive a URL. This URL will be used to invoke the Lambda function through API Gateway.

#### 4. **Test the Function**

Now that everything is set up, you can test the function by navigating to the provided API URL in your browser or using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

For example:

bash

CopyEdit

`curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/`

You should receive a response like this:

json

CopyEdit

`"Hello, World!"`

### Conclusion

This is a basic example of how you can use AWS Lambda to create a serverless function that responds to HTTP requests. The function is simple, but you can extend it to handle more complex logic, integrate with databases, and respond to other AWS event triggers.
