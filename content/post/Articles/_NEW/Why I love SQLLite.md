Then explain that SQLite is a great low ceremony engine . Explain that it’s a great engine to use to start a project quickly and it’s a grata engine to run unit tests on . Then explain how you use SQLite everyday because it’s included in the standard sdks for android and iOS . If you use an app on your phone it’s likely SQLite. Then explain what it’s not good for -multi user . Then make a chart of syntax comparing the syntax of SQLite to Microsoft sql , MySQL , to Postgres. Then make a chart of features comparing the syntax of SQLite to Microsoft sql , MySQL , to Postgres.

SQLite is a free, open-source, serverless relational database engine that is self-contained and requires zero configuration. Unlike traditional client-server databases, SQLite is embedded directly into applications, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking simplicity and efficiency.

**Origins and History**

SQLite was created by D. Richard Hipp in the spring of 2000 while working for General Dynamics on a U.S. Navy project. He needed a lightweight, reliable database that could operate without the overhead of a separate server process. This led to the development of SQLite as a Tcl extension, with its first version released in August 2000. Over the years, SQLite has evolved into one of the most widely used database engines, embedded in countless applications and devices.

**A Low-Ceremony Engine**

One of the standout features of SQLite is its minimalistic design. Being serverless, it eliminates the need for configuration, management, and maintenance associated with traditional databases. This "low ceremony" approach allows developers to integrate a robust database engine into their applications with minimal effort, facilitating rapid development and deployment.

**Ideal for Rapid Prototyping and Unit Testing**

SQLite's lightweight nature makes it an excellent choice for starting projects quickly. Developers can prototype applications without the need to set up complex database environments. Additionally, its simplicity and ease of use make it a preferred option for running unit tests, ensuring that database interactions work as intended without external dependencies.

**Ubiquitous Presence in Mobile Platforms**

SQLite is included in the standard SDKs for both Android and iOS platforms. This means that many mobile applications rely on SQLite for data storage. Whether it's storing user preferences, caching data, or managing complex datasets, SQLite provides a reliable and efficient solution. Chances are, if you're using an app on your phone, it's leveraging SQLite under the hood.

**Limitations: Not Suited for Multi-User Environments**

While SQLite excels in single-user applications, it is not designed for high-concurrency, multi-user scenarios. Its locking mechanism allows multiple readers but only one writer at a time, which can become a bottleneck in applications requiring simultaneous write operations from multiple users. For such use cases, traditional client-server databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server are more appropriate.

**Syntax Comparison**

Below is a comparison of basic SQL syntax across SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL:

| Operation        | SQLite                                                    | Microsoft SQL Server                                                   | MySQL                                                                       | PostgreSQL                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Select Data**  | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                    | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                                 | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                                      | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                          |
| **Update Data**  | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`             | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                          | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                               | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                   |
| **Delete Data**  | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                         | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                                      | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                                           | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                               |
