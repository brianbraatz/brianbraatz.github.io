Ah, Angular 13‚Äîthe version where the Angular team decided to go full throttle on performance, developer experience, and saying goodbye to things that were holding us back.

***

## üöÄ New Features in Angular 13

### 1. No More View Engine (Goodbye, Old Friend)

Angular 13 completely removes the old View Engine and fully embraces Ivy. If you‚Äôve been procrastinating on upgrading, now‚Äôs the time!

```json
{ "enableIvy": true }
```

### 2. Goodbye IE11 (No More Ancient Tech!)

Angular 13 drops support for Internet Explorer 11. This means no more worrying about outdated JS features for an almost extinct browser.

### 3. Faster Builds with Persistent Build Cache

Angular CLI 13 enables persistent build caching by default, making your builds significantly faster.

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

### 4. Component API Enhancements

Creating dynamic components just got a whole lot easier with simplified API updates.

```typescript
const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent(MyComponent);
```

### 5. Improved Angular Tests

The TestBed now does smarter cleanup between tests, making test runs faster and less memory-hungry.

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent]
  }).compileComponents();
});
```

### 6. TypeScript 4.4+ Support

Angular 13 embraces TypeScript 4.4+, unlocking better type inference and stricter typing.

```typescript
const obj: Readonly<{ name: string }> = { name: "Angular" };
```

### 7. Inline Fonts Optimization

By default, Angular now inlines fonts in your production builds for faster loading times.

```json
{
  "optimization": true,
  "inlineFonts": true
}
```

### 8. Forms API Updates

Angular 13 removes support for "AbstractControl#parent" and introduces improvements to typed forms.

```typescript
const myForm = new FormGroup({
  name: new FormControl<string>(''),
});
```
