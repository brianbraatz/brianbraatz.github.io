### 1. Why were client-side frameworks like Angular introduced?

Before frameworks like Angular, developers used VanillaJS and jQuery to create dynamic websites.

However, as applications grew in complexity, managing state, data binding, and DOM manipulation became tedious.\
(VERY TEDIOUS)

Angular introduced **client-side frameworks** to solve these challenges by:

* Providing **better separation of concerns** with components.
* Enabling **efficient data binding**.
* Offering **structured application development**.

### 2. How does an Angular application work?

An Angular application follows a modular architecture.

1. The **angular.json** file defines configurations.
2. The **main.ts** file bootstraps the app by loading the `AppModule`.
3. The **app.module.ts** file declares components and modules.
4. The **index.html** file loads the root component `<app-root>`, which initiates rendering.

### 3. What are some advantages of Angular over other frameworks?

* **Built-in Features**: Angular provides routing, state management, RxJS, and HTTP services.
* **Declarative UI**: Uses HTML templates instead of complex JavaScript code.
* **Google’s Long-term Support**: Ensures continuous improvements and reliability.

### 4. How does Angular compare with React?

| Feature              | Angular       | React                               |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Data Binding         | Bidirectional | Unidirectional                      |
| Dependency Injection | Yes           | No (requires third-party libraries) |
| Mobile Development   | Supported     | Requires React Native               |
| Language             | TypeScript    | JavaScript                          |

### 5. How does Angular differ from AngularJS?

| Feature        | AngularJS       | Angular                                   |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Architecture   | MVC             | Component-based                           |
| Language       | JavaScript      | TypeScript                                |
| Mobile Support | No              | Yes                                       |
| Data Binding   | Two-way binding | Improved two-way binding with observables |

***

### 6. Understand the MVVM architecture.

Angular follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture:

* **Model**: Represents business logic.
* **View**: Handles UI rendering.
* **ViewModel**: Binds data between Model and View.

### 7. What is Change Detection in Angular?

Change detection synchronizes the application state with the UI. Angular follows a **unidirectional data flow**, updating the UI efficiently.

### 8. What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation?

Angular provides two types of compilation:

* **JIT (Just-in-Time)**: Compilation happens in the browser at runtime.
* **AOT (Ahead-of-Time)**: Compilation happens during the build phase, improving performance.

### 9. What are HTTP interceptors?

HTTP interceptors allow modifying HTTP requests globally. Example:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const clonedReq = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: `Bearer token` } });
    return next.handle(clonedReq);
  }
}
```

### 10. What are Observables in Angular?

Observables (RxJS) allow handling asynchronous data streams. Unlike Promises, **Observables can emit multiple values over time**.

```typescript
const myObservable = new Observable(observer => {
  observer.next('Hello');
  observer.complete();
});
myObservable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
```

***

### 11. What is View Encapsulation?

View Encapsulation ensures that styles defined in a component do not leak to other components.

| Encapsulation Mode     | Behavior                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **None**               | Styles apply globally                    |
| **Emulated (Default)** | Styles are scoped to the component       |
| **ShadowDom**          | Uses native Shadow DOM for encapsulation |

### 12. What is Angular Universal?

Angular Universal enables **server-side rendering (SSR)**, which improves **SEO** and initial page load performance.

### 13. What are Pipes in Angular?

Pipes transform data before displaying it. Example:

```typescript
<p>{{ today | date: 'fullDate' }}</p>
```

Creating a custom pipe:

```typescript
@Pipe({ name: 'customPipe' })
export class CustomPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

### 14. What are Angular Decorators?

Decorators in Angular provide metadata configuration. Examples:

* `@Component()` – Defines a component.
* `@NgModule()` – Defines a module.
* `@Injectable()` – Defines a service.

### 15. What is the purpose of `ngOnInit()`?

`ngOnInit()` is a lifecycle hook called after component initialization:

```typescript
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log("Component initialized");
  }
}
```

### 16. How does Angular handle security vulnerabilities?

Security is a critical aspect of Angular development. Angular has built-in protections against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, and **Clickjacking**. Some key security measures include:

* **Sanitization**: Angular automatically sanitizes user input in templates to prevent XSS attacks.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts the sources from which scripts can be executed.
* **HttpClient Security**: Prevents CSRF by allowing developers to use HTTP interceptors for authentication tokens.
* **Strict Contextual Escaping**: Ensures that dynamic data is treated safely.

### 17. What are Angular Zones, and how do they affect change detection?

Angular **Zones** (via Zone.js) help track asynchronous operations to determine when change detection should run. Angular’s **NgZone** allows developers to optimize performance by controlling how and when change detection occurs.

Example of running code outside Angular’s zone to improve performance:

```typescript
import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-optimized',
  template: '<button (click)="doWork()">Run Task</button>'
})
export class OptimizedComponent {
  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}

  doWork() {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Task completed outside Angular zone');
      }, 2000);
    });
  }
}
```

This prevents unnecessary UI updates and improves application performance.

### 18. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal?

Angular Universal enables **server-side rendering (SSR)**, allowing Angular applications to pre-render pages on the server before sending them to the client. This improves:

* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Since crawlers can index pre-rendered pages.
* **Performance**: Faster initial page load times.
* **User Experience**: Content is visible immediately, even before JavaScript loads.

To enable Angular Universal:

```bash
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
```

### 19. What are Signals in Angular, and how do they work?

**Signals** are a new reactivity model introduced in Angular to improve **state management** and **change detection**. They enable fine-grained reactivity without triggering unnecessary component updates.

Example of using Signals:

```typescript
import { signal } from '@angular/core';

const counter = signal(0);

function increment() {
  counter.set(counter() + 1);
}
```

### 20. How does Angular optimize rendering with TrackBy in ngFor?

By default, Angular **re-renders all elements** when an array changes. Using `trackBy`, Angular can track items more efficiently and update only the changed ones.

Example:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-list',
  template: `<div *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackById">{{ item.name }}</div>`
})
export class ListComponent {
  items = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }
  ];

  trackById(index: number, item: any) {
    return item.id;
  }
}
```

***

### 21. How do you handle memory leaks in an Angular application?

Memory leaks can cause performance issues. Strategies to avoid them include:

* **Unsubscribing from Observables** using `takeUntil` or `ngOnDestroy`.
* **Using async pipes** to automatically unsubscribe.
* **Avoiding detached DOM elements** holding references.

Example:

```typescript
@Component({...})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnDestroy {
  private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();

  constructor(private service: DataService) {
    this.service.getData()
      .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
      .subscribe(data => console.log(data));
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}
```

### 22. How do you handle error handling in an Angular application?

Error handling should be implemented globally for better maintainability. Use an **HTTP interceptor** to catch API errors:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ErrorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    return next.handle(req).pipe(
      catchError(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        return throwError(() => new Error('Something went wrong!'));
      })
    );
  }
}
```

### 23. How does Angular handle state management?

For small applications, **RxJS BehaviorSubject** is sufficient. For larger applications, **NgRx or Akita** provides structured state management.

Example using BehaviorSubject:

```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class StateService {
  private state = new BehaviorSubject<string>('default state');
  state$ = this.state.asObservable();

  updateState(newState: string) {
    this.state.next(newState);
  }
}
```

### 24. What is Angular Universal, and how does it impact performance?

**Angular Universal** enables **server-side rendering (SSR)**, allowing Angular applications to pre-render pages on the server before sending them to the client. Benefits include:

* **Improved SEO**: Search engines can index pre-rendered pages more effectively.
* **Faster Initial Page Load**: Reduces the time it takes for content to be displayed.
* **Enhanced Performance on Low-Powered Devices**: Since SSR offloads rendering work from the client.

To set up Angular Universal:

```bash
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
```

### 25. How does Change Detection work in Angular, and how can you optimize it?

Angular uses a **Change Detection Mechanism** to update the UI when data changes. The default **ChangeDetectionStrategy** is `Default`, which checks all components in a tree.

For performance improvements, use `OnPush`:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-optimized',
  templateUrl: './optimized.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class OptimizedComponent {
  @Input() data: string;
}
```

This ensures change detection runs **only when the `@Input` reference changes**, reducing unnecessary updates.

### 26. What is the difference between Reactive Forms and Template-Driven Forms in Angular?

| Feature            | Reactive Forms                              | Template-Driven Forms          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Complexity**     | Ideal for complex forms                     | Simpler for basic forms        |
| **Validation**     | Uses explicit `FormControl` and `FormGroup` | Uses directives like `ngModel` |
| **Scalability**    | More scalable                               | Less scalable for large apps   |
| **Code Structure** | Programmatically created                    | Declared in the template       |

Example of a **Reactive Form**:

```typescript
this.form = new FormGroup({
  name: new FormControl('', [Validators.required]),
  email: new FormControl('', [Validators.email])
});
```

### 27. What are NgModules, and how do they help in structuring an Angular application?

NgModules are containers for components, directives, pipes, and services, helping modularize an Angular application. Example of **feature module**:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [DashboardComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  exports: [DashboardComponent]
})
export class DashboardModule {}
```

Using **Lazy Loading**, we can improve performance:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'dashboard', loadChildren: () => import('./dashboard.module').then(m => m.DashboardModule) }
];
```

### 28. How does Angular handle security vulnerabilities?

Angular has built-in protections against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, and **Clickjacking**. Security measures include:

* **Sanitization**: Angular automatically sanitizes user input.
* **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Restricts sources for scripts.
* **HttpClient Security**: Uses interceptors for authentication tokens.

### 29. What is an Angular Service Worker, and how does it improve application performance?

An Angular **Service Worker** enables **progressive web app (PWA) capabilities** like offline caching, background sync, and push notifications.

To set up a service worker:

```bash
ng add @angular/pwa
```

Service Worker improves performance by caching static assets and API responses, reducing server requests.

### 30. How do you write unit tests for an Angular Component?

Angular uses **Jasmine** and **Karma** for testing. Example unit test:

```typescript
describe('AppComponent', () => {
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<AppComponent>;
  let component: AppComponent;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent]
    });
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });

  it('should create the component', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### 31. What are the best practices for optimizing Angular applications?

Angular applications can suffer from performance issues as they grow. Here are some **best practices** to optimize your app:

* **Use OnPush Change Detection**: Reduce unnecessary re-renders by using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
* **Lazy Load Modules**: Load feature modules only when needed using `loadChildren`.
* **Optimize Template Rendering**: Use `trackBy` in `*ngFor` to prevent unnecessary DOM manipulations.
* **Use Pure Pipes**: Ensure pipes are pure to prevent unnecessary recalculations.
* **Minimize DOM Updates**: Avoid direct DOM manipulation and use Angular’s binding mechanisms.
* **Efficient RxJS Usage**: Use operators like `debounceTime`, `switchMap`, and `takeUntil` to manage subscriptions effectively.

***

### 32. What is Route Guards in Angular?

**Route Guards** help **control navigation** within an Angular application. They **restrict access to certain routes** based on conditions like authentication status, permissions, or data availability.

Types of Route Guards:

* `CanActivate`: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing routes.
* `CanDeactivate`: Prevents users from leaving a route without confirmation.
* `Resolve`: Pre-fetches data before navigating to a route.
* `CanLoad`: Prevents lazy-loaded modules from being loaded if conditions aren’t met.

Example:

```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      this.router.navigate(['/login']);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

***

### 33. How do you implement state management in Angular?

State management is crucial for handling data efficiently in Angular applications. **Common state management solutions include:**

* **RxJS and BehaviorSubject**: Simple and lightweight for managing shared state.
* **NgRx (Redux for Angular)**: Predictable state management using **Actions, Reducers, and Effects**.
* **Akita**: State management with a simple API.
* **NgXS**: State management similar to NgRx but with fewer boilerplate requirements.

Example using NgRx:

```typescript
// Actions
export const addItem = createAction('[Items] Add', props<{ item: string }>());

// Reducer
export const itemsReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(addItem, (state, { item }) => [...state, item])
);
```

***

### 34. How do you test Angular applications?

Angular applications should be tested using:

* **Unit Tests (Jasmine & Karma)**: For testing components and services.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Protractor/Cypress)**: For testing full workflows.
* **Mocking Services**: Using `HttpTestingController` to mock API responses.

Example unit test for a component:

```typescript
describe('AppComponent', () => {
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<AppComponent>;
  let component: AppComponent;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent]
    });
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });

  it('should create the component', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

***

### 35. How do you debug Angular applications effectively?

Debugging Angular applications requires the right tools and techniques:

* **Use Augury Chrome Extension**: Visualizes Angular component trees.
* **Leverage Browser Developer Tools**: Use `console.log`, breakpoints, and network monitoring.
* **Debug Change Detection Issues**: Use `ng.profiler.timeChangeDetection()` in the console.
* **Check RxJS Streams**: Use `tap()` for logging Observable values.
* **Enable Strict Mode in TypeScript**: Helps catch errors early.

***

### 36. What is Hybrid Rendering in Angular?

Hybrid rendering combines **server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)** for optimized performance.

Benefits:

* **Faster initial load times**.
* **Better SEO** for search engines.
* **Reduced client-side computation** for complex pages.

Example of implementing SSR using Angular Universal:

```bash
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
```

***

### 37. What is the difference between HTTP Interceptors and Guards in Angular?

| Feature     | HTTP Interceptors                         | Route Guards                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Modifies HTTP requests/responses globally | Controls navigation based on conditions   |
| Runs On     | Every HTTP request                        | Before navigating to a route              |
| Common Uses | Add authentication tokens, modify headers | Restrict access to routes, pre-fetch data |

Example of an HTTP interceptor:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const clonedReq = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: `Bearer token` } });
    return next.handle(clonedReq);
  }
}
```

### 38. What is Angular CDK (Component Dev Kit)?

The **Angular Component Dev Kit (CDK)** provides a set of behavior-driven tools and utilities that help developers create custom UI components while following Material Design principles.

Key Features of Angular CDK:

* **Drag and Drop**: Enables draggable UI components.
* **Overlay**: Helps create floating panels like modals and dropdowns.
* **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficiently loads large lists.
* **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensures applications are usable by people with disabilities.

Example of CDK Drag and Drop:

```typescript
import { DragDropModule } from '@angular/cdk/drag-drop';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-draggable-list',
  template: `<div cdkDrag>Drag me!</div>`
})
export class DraggableListComponent {}
```

***

### 39. What are Template-Driven Forms vs. Reactive Forms?

Angular provides two types of forms:

* **Template-Driven Forms**: Uses Angular directives (`ngModel`) to bind data.
* **Reactive Forms**: Uses `FormGroup` and `FormControl` to manage state programmatically.

Example of Reactive Form:

```typescript
this.form = new FormGroup({
  name: new FormControl('', [Validators.required]),
  email: new FormControl('', [Validators.email])
});
```

***

### 40. How does Angular handle i18n (Internationalization)?

Angular provides built-in support for **internationalization (i18n)** to create multi-language applications.

Steps to enable i18n:

1. Add translation markers in the template:
   ```html
   <p i18n>Hello, world!</p>
   ```
2. Extract translations:
   ```bash
   ng extract-i18n
   ```
3. Translate and build for a specific locale:
   ```bash
   ng build --localize
   ```

***
