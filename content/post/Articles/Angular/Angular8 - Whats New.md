# Whats New in Angular 8?

Ah, Angular 8!

## The version where things get a bit fancier, a little faster, and developers collectively sighed in relief at some much-needed improvements.

## üöÄ New Features in Angular 8

### 1. Differential Loading of JavaScript

Angular 8 introduced differential loading, which means your modern browsers get modern JS, while older browsers get the legacy stuff. This improves performance significantly.

```html
<script type="module" src="modern-bundle.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="legacy-bundle.js"></script>
```

### 2. Lazy Loading with Dynamic Imports

Previously, lazy loading used a string-based syntax. Now, it's more TypeScript-y and supports dynamic imports!

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'lazy', loadChildren: () => import('./lazy/lazy.module').then(m => m.LazyModule) }
];
```

### 3. Web Workers for Performance

Need to offload heavy computations to a separate thread? Web Workers are officially supported now!

```bash
ng generate web-worker my-worker
```

### 4. Bazel Support (Experimental)

Bazel allows faster incremental builds and better dependency management. It‚Äôs still experimental but promising!

```json
"builders": {
  "build": "@angular/bazel"
}
```

### 5. Ivy Rendering Engine (Still in Preview)

Ivy was getting polished in Angular 8 but wasn‚Äôt the default yet. It improves bundle size and debugging!

```typescript
{ "enableIvy": true }
```

### 6. Support for TypeScript 3.4+

Angular 8 brings support for the latest TypeScript goodies, like const assertions:

```typescript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30] as const;
```

### 7. Location Strategies Improved

Base href handling got better for lazy-loaded modules!

```typescript
providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/' }]
```
