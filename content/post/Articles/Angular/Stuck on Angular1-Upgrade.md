# What If You Are Stuck on Angular 1 and Next.js – Can You Upgrade?

I worked on a project not too long ago that was stuck on Angular and Next.js.

Not the sparkling fancy Angular.. no the old AngularJS..

That's what motived this article \ thoughts \ Collected widsom on Upgrade possibilities.. or not..

<!-- 
So, you're stuck maintaining an old Angular 1 app and a Next.js project, and you're wondering if you can upgrade. Maybe you inherited this mess, or maybe you've just been putting it off for too long. Either way, let’s talk about your options, the challenges, and whether upgrading is even worth the effort.

## The Angular 1 Dilemma

AngularJS (Angular 1) was amazing…

back in 2010.

MySpace was cool then- and so was Yahoo!

Fast forward to today, and it’s like keeping a fax machine in a world of instant messaging.

Google officially ended long-term support for AngularJS in **December 2021**, which means no security patches, no updates, and a growing risk of breaking dependencies.

### Can You Upgrade?

If you’re asking, *“Can I upgrade directly from AngularJS to Angular 17?”*, the short answer is *no*. The two frameworks are fundamentally different.

### Upgrade Options:

1. **Angular Upgrade (ngUpgrade)** – This allows running AngularJS and modern Angular together while gradually migrating components. Good if you can’t afford a full rewrite immediately.
2. **Full Rewrite in Angular** – If your project isn’t massive, consider a full rewrite in Angular (17+).
3. **Move to a Different Framework** – If you’re already modernizing, consider moving to **React, Vue, or even Next.js** instead of sticking with Angular.

## Should You Upgrade?

Here’s the real question: *Is it worth upgrading, or should you just keep patching the old code?*

* **If you’re on AngularJS**, upgrading is almost inevitable. Security risks, lack of updates, and declining community support make it a liability.
* **If you’re on an old Next.js version**, upgrading is **highly recommended** but not as urgent as AngularJS.
* **If your project works fine and has no critical security issues**, you might delay upgrading—but tech debt will eventually catch up.

## The Verdict

* **AngularJS? Start planning your escape now.**
* **Old Next.js? Upgrade when feasible—it’s much easier.**
* **Rewriting? Consider if another framework (React, Vue, or Remix) might be a better fit.**

Upgrading legacy code is always painful, but future-proofing your application will save you time, money, and headaches down the line. Good luck!
