# Comparing SOAP Migration Strategies: API Gateways vs. GraphQL Middleware vs. Simple Code Approaches

## Introduction

Migrating a **legacy SOAP-based system** to REST involves multiple strategies, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs. The approaches we’ve previously discussed include:

1. **Simple Code-Based Approaches** – Writing custom wrappers and manual conversions.
2. **GraphQL as Middleware** – Providing an abstraction layer while gradually migrating to REST.
3. **Deploying an API Gateway** – Routing requests dynamically to SOAP or REST endpoints.

In this article, we’ll compare **API Gateway solutions (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway)** with the other migration strategies. We’ll discuss the **history, cost, implementation complexity, and ideal use cases** for each approach.

***

## Understanding API Gateways

An **API Gateway** acts as a **reverse proxy** that routes client requests to different backend services based on rules. This means that during migration, the gateway can send **some requests to SOAP** and **some to REST**, enabling a smooth transition.

### **Popular API Gateways**

| API Gateway         | History                          | Pricing                              | Strengths                           | Weaknesses                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Kong Gateway**    | Launched in 2015, based on Nginx | Open-source, paid enterprise edition | Lightweight, fast, supports plugins | Requires infrastructure setup |
| **Apigee** (Google) | Acquired by Google in 2016       | Premium SaaS                         | Strong analytics, API security      | High pricing                  |
| **AWS API Gateway** | Introduced in 2015 by AWS        | Pay-per-use                          | Fully managed, integrates with AWS  | Tied to AWS ecosystem         |

### **How API Gateways Handle SOAP to REST Migration**

* **SOAP endpoints are proxied** via the API Gateway.
* **Requests are rewritten** dynamically (e.g., transforming JSON REST calls into SOAP XML).
* **Rate limiting, caching, and authentication** are handled at the gateway level.

#### **Example: Kong Gateway Config for SOAP to REST Routing**

```yaml
services:
  - name: legacy-soap-service
    url: http://soap-backend.example.com
    routes:
      - name: soap-route
        paths:
          - /api/v1/users
          - /api/v1/orders
```

## Comparing Approaches: API Gateway vs. GraphQL vs. Simple Code

### **1. Simple Code-Based Approach**

**Description**: Writing custom scripts or middleware to translate REST calls into SOAP requests.

* **Pros:** Fully customizable, no dependency on external services.
* **Cons:** High development effort, requires ongoing maintenance.

**Example:**

```python
import requests

def get_user(user_id):
    soap_request = f"""
    <GetUserRequest>
       <userId>{user_id}</userId>
    </GetUserRequest>
    """
    response = requests.post("http://legacy-soap-service", data=soap_request)
    return response.text
```

***

### **2. GraphQL as Middleware**

**Description**: GraphQL sits between the client and the backend, abstracting SOAP and REST differences.

* **Pros:** Flexible queries, allows gradual migration.
* **Cons:** Adds complexity, requires GraphQL infrastructure.

**Example:**

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}
```

***

### **3. API Gateway Approach**

**Description**: An API Gateway dynamically routes requests to SOAP or REST, handling protocol transformations.

* **Pros:** No code changes, centralized API management.
* **Cons:** Potential vendor lock-in, cost of managed solutions.

**Example:** AWS API Gateway SOAP Integration:

```json
{
  "type": "AWS",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "uri": "https://legacy-soap-endpoint.com",
  "requestTemplates": {
    "application/json": "{ \"GetUserRequest\": { \"userId\": $input.params('id') } }"
  }
}
```

***

## Cost & Complexity Comparison

| Approach                 | Implementation Complexity | Cost   | Best For                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Simple Code Approach** | High                      | Low    | Small teams, full control        |
| **GraphQL Middleware**   | Medium                    | Medium | Apps needing flexible queries    |
| **API Gateway**          | Low                       | Varies | Large-scale enterprise migration |

***

## When to Use Each Approach

### **Use API Gateway When:**

* You want to **avoid modifying existing services**.
* You need **centralized API management** (authentication, caching, rate limiting).
* You prefer **low-maintenance solutions**.

### **Use GraphQL Middleware When:**

* Your application requires **flexible data queries**.
* You’re **gradually replacing SOAP with REST**.
* You want to **abstract backend differences**.

### **Use Simple Code When:**

* Your team has **strong development expertise**.
* You need **full control** over the migration process.
* You prefer **lightweight, dependency-free solutions**.

***

## Conclusion

Choosing between **API Gateways, GraphQL Middleware, and Simple Code Approaches** depends on **cost, complexity, and long-term maintenance needs**.

* **API Gateway** is the best choice for **enterprise-level** projects that need **centralized control and minimal changes to legacy services**.
* **GraphQL Middleware** is ideal for teams that need **flexibility and incremental migration**.
* **Simple Code Approaches** work well for **small teams** that want **full customization** without external dependencies.

By understanding the trade-offs of each approach, teams can **choose the right migration path** that balances **cost, effort, and future scalability**.
