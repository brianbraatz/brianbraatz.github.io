# How to Keep OpenAPI Documents Up to Date with Manual Documentation

So, you've got your fancy OpenAPI docs set up, your API is humming along, and everything looks perfect. But give it a few months (or even weeks), and suddenly... the docs are **outdated**.

Endpoints change. Parameters shift. That one developer swore they'd update the docs but totally didn't. Now, you're left with a sad, outdated OpenAPI file that barely resembles reality.

Let's fix that.

## Why Do OpenAPI Docs Go Out of Date?

There are a few common reasons why OpenAPI docs fall behind:

* **Developers are busy** – Code comes first; docs are an afterthought.
* **Lack of automation** – If updates aren’t part of the workflow, they get ignored.
* **API evolution** – APIs change faster than people remember to update the docs.
* **No accountability** – Nobody "owns" the documentation process.
* **Manual updates are painful** – Updating YAML or JSON manually is no one’s favorite pastime.

But don’t worry! There are ways to keep your OpenAPI docs fresh without making it a full-time job.

***

## 🔥 The Secret to Up-to-Date OpenAPI Docs: A Process

Keeping OpenAPI documentation updated **manually** isn’t impossible—it just requires a good process. Here’s how:

### 1. **Make Docs Part of the Development Workflow**

If updating OpenAPI docs isn’t a required step, it won’t happen. Period. Here’s how to make it a habit:

* **Pull Requests Must Include API Doc Updates**\
  Every API change should come with an OpenAPI update. Make it a rule: *No API change gets merged without a matching documentation update*.

* **Code Reviews Must Check OpenAPI Docs**\
  Whoever reviews the PR should also review the OpenAPI spec. If the docs are missing, **reject** the PR.

* **Track OpenAPI Updates in Git**\
  Keep your OpenAPI file in version control (**Git, SVN, etc.**) so changes are tracked just like code.

***

### 2. **Use OpenAPI Comments in Code (When Possible)**

Some frameworks allow you to **annotate API endpoints** directly in code, making updates **automatic**.

#### Example: Python (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}", summary="Get user by ID", description="Returns user details.")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id, "name": "John Doe"}
```

Since FastAPI **auto-generates OpenAPI docs**, there’s no excuse for outdated documentation.

#### Example: Node.js (Express + JSDoc)

```javascript
/**
 * @openapi
 * /users/{id}:
 *   get:
 *     summary: Get user by ID
 *     description: Returns user details
 *     parameters:
 *       - name: id
 *         in: path
 *         required: true
 *         schema:
 *           type: integer
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: Successful response
 */
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ userId: req.params.id, name: "John Doe" });
});
```

This method ensures **code and docs stay in sync**.

***

### 3. **Schedule Regular OpenAPI Audits**

Even with good habits, **things slip through the cracks**. That’s why you should schedule **manual documentation audits** every few weeks.

#### Suggested Audit Checklist:

✔ **Compare OpenAPI docs to actual API behavior**\
✔ **Test API calls and ensure responses match the documentation**\
✔ **Verify all endpoints are still active**\
✔ **Check for missing query parameters, headers, or body fields**\
✔ **Confirm descriptions make sense to external users**

This can be done **every sprint** or at the **start of each month**.

***

### 4. **Use API Linting & Validation Tools**

If you don’t trust humans to update OpenAPI docs, let **robots** help.

Here are some tools to **validate** your OpenAPI docs and catch errors:

* **Spectral** – Lint your OpenAPI docs for missing or incorrect fields.
  ```sh
  npm install -g @stoplight/spectral
  spectral lint openapi.yaml
  ```

* **Swagger Editor** – Quickly test and validate OpenAPI JSON/YAML files.\
  Run it locally:
  ```sh
  docker run -p 8080:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor
  ```

* **Redocly CLI** – Lint and validate OpenAPI for Redoc users.
  ```sh
  npm install -g @redocly/cli
  redocly lint openapi.yaml
  ```

Set up these tools in your **CI/CD pipeline** to catch issues **before merging changes**.

***

### 5. **Use a Changelog for API Changes**

A simple **changelog** helps track API changes and keeps documentation transparent.

#### Example Changelog Format:

```
## [1.2.0] - 2023-06-10
### Added
- New endpoint `/orders/{id}/refund`
- `order_status` query parameter for `/orders`

### Changed
- `/users/{id}` now returns `last_login` timestamp

### Removed
- Deprecated `/v1/orders` (use `/v2/orders` instead)
```

You can store the changelog in:

✅ **API Docs (`changelog.md`)**\
✅ **OpenAPI Spec (`openapi.yaml`)**\
✅ **Git Commit Messages (`CHANGELOG.md`)**

***

### 6. **Assign Documentation Ownership**

If "everyone" owns API documentation, **nobody** owns it. Assign **specific people** to review and maintain OpenAPI files.

#### Who Can Own OpenAPI Documentation?

* **Tech leads** – Ensure docs are accurate before releases.
* **Backend devs** – Update OpenAPI whenever API changes.
* **API documentation team** – Review docs from a user perspective.

Even better, **rotate ownership** each sprint to keep everyone accountable.

## Manual Documentation Advice

| Step                        | Action                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Enforce Docs in PRs**  | No API change gets merged without OpenAPI updates.            |
| **2. Use Code Annotations** | Embed OpenAPI info directly in code (if possible).            |
| **3. Audit Regularly**      | Schedule documentation checks every sprint.                   |
| **4. Automate Validation**  | Use Spectral, Swagger Editor, or Redocly CLI to catch issues. |
| **5. Maintain a Changelog** | Track API changes in a structured format.                     |
| **6. Assign Ownership**     | Designate specific team members to maintain OpenAPI docs.     |

## Conclusion

Keeping OpenAPI documentation **up to date manually** isn’t fun, but it’s totally doable with the right process.

By making API documentation **part of the development workflow**, leveraging **code annotations**, and using **validation tools**, you can prevent your docs from rotting into oblivion.

Now go forth and **document like a pro**! 🏆
