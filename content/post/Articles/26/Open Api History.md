### **The Origins (2010)**

Swagger was first created in **2010** by **Tony Tam**, a developer at **Reverb Technologies** (formerly **Wordnik**).

It started as an **open-source project** designed to solve a common problem: **documenting RESTful APIs** in a way that was both **machine-readable and human-friendly**.

Before Swagger, API documentation was often a **mess**—either scattered across various wiki pages or written in long, unreadable text files. Developers struggled with inconsistent documentation, making API consumption difficult.

### **Early Growth (2011-2014)**

Swagger gained **rapid popularity** in the early 2010s as companies realized its benefits. It introduced:

* **A standardized way to describe APIs** using JSON/YAML
* **Interactive API documentation** with the Swagger UI
* **Code generation tools** that allowed developers to create API clients and server stubs automatically

I started using it around 2015, the appeal being how it took alot of pain out of maintaining APIs and documentation.

### **SmartBear Acquisition (2015)**

In **2015**, **SmartBear Software** acquired Swagger. Instead of keeping it closed-source, they **donated it to the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)**, a Linux Foundation project aimed at **standardizing API specifications**.

This was a big moment because it ensured Swagger (now called **OpenAPI Specification** or **OAS**) would remain open and widely adopted.

### **Rebranding & OpenAPI Specification (2016-Present)**

After joining OAI, the specification was renamed **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**, but the **Swagger tools (Swagger UI, Swagger Editor, etc.) remained**.

Since then:

* **2017:** OpenAPI 3.0 was released, bringing major improvements in API definitions.
* **2021:** OpenAPI 3.1 was released, aligning more closely with JSON Schema.
* **Now:** OpenAPI remains the **gold standard** for defining APIs, with Swagger tools widely used alongside other solutions like Postman and Redoc.

### **Legacy & Impact**

Swagger revolutionized **REST API documentation** and development. Today, it is:

* **Used by thousands of companies** (including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon)
* **A critical part of modern API development workflows**
* **The foundation of the OpenAPI Specification**, which is supported by countless tools and frameworks

Even though OpenAPI is the official standard, **many people still call it Swagger**, showing how deeply it has influenced the industry.

## **I STILL CALL IT SWAGGER! :)**
