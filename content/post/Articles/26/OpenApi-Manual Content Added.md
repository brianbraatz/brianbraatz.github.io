So, you've got yourself an OpenAPI-compliant API, and now you need to manually add some documentation to it.

While OpenAPI is great for generating docs automatically, there are always those little detailsâ€”business logic, examples, explanationsâ€”that need a human touch.

***

## 1. **Use OpenAPI Descriptions and Annotations**

The first step is to make the most of what OpenAPI already provides:

* **`summary` and `description` fields**\
  Each endpoint, request, and response can have a `summary` and `description` field. Use them! They help developers understand the *why*, not just the *what*.

* **Parameter and response descriptions**\
  Every query parameter, header, and response should have a clear explanation.

* **Examples in `example` or `examples` fields**\
  Show real-world usage with examples inside OpenAPI itself.

### Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: "Retrieve all users"
      description: "Gets a list of users in the system. Only admin users can see all accounts."
      parameters:
        - name: role
          in: query
          description: "Filter users by role (admin, user, guest)"
          schema:
            type: string
            example: "admin"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: "A list of users"
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
              example:
                - id: 1
                  name: "John Doe"
                  role: "admin"
```

***

## 2. **Write External Documentation with Markdown**

Sometimes, API descriptions in OpenAPI files arenâ€™t enough. You can link external documentation using OpenAPIâ€™s `externalDocs` field.

### Example:

```yaml
externalDocs:
  description: "Detailed API Usage Guide"
  url: "https://docs.example.com/api-guide"
```

For deeper documentation, maintain a separate Markdown file with details like:

* Business rules behind the API
* Advanced usage scenarios
* Code samples in different languages

You can store these docs in a GitHub wiki, a README file, or an API documentation site like **ReadTheDocs**.

***

## 3. **Use API Documentation Platforms (Swagger UI, Redoc, Stoplight)**

Swagger UI, Redoc, and Stoplight let you display OpenAPI specs beautifully. But they also allow manual documentation additions.

### Swagger UI Customization:

* Add descriptions and Markdown formatting.
* Include authentication notes and usage examples.
* Use `x-tags` and `x-summary` for better organization.

### Redoc Features:

* Custom sidebars for extra docs
* Embedded HTML for detailed guides
* Better styling for descriptions

If you want a mix of manual and generated docs, these tools make it easy.

***

## 4. **Provide Real-World Code Examples**

Nothing beats real-world usage examples. Add a `x-codeSamples` extension to OpenAPI or manually include them in Markdown-based documentation.

Example with OpenAPI Extension:

```yaml
x-codeSamples:
  - lang: "cURL"
    source: |
      curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/users" -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
  - lang: "Python"
    source: |
      import requests
      headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN"}
      response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users", headers=headers)
      print(response.json())
```

If your documentation is in a separate guide, include full API request/response examples in different programming languages.

***

## 5. **Use GitHub (or Any VCS) for Version-Controlled Docs**

Documentation needs to evolve with your API. Store manual documentation alongside your OpenAPI specs in a version-controlled repo.

### Best Practices:

* **Keep docs in `/docs` or `/openapi/docs` folder.**
* **Use GitHub Pages or ReadTheDocs for hosting.**
* **Document API changes in `CHANGELOG.md` or a `docs/updates.md` file.**

This ensures your documentation remains **accurate, up to date, and tied to the API version**.

***

## 6. **Enable User Feedback & Contributions**

No matter how great your documentation is, users will have questions. Enable feedback:

* **GitHub Issues for Documentation**\
  Allow users to report unclear sections.

* **Discussions/Forums**\
  Provide a space where developers can share insights and solutions.

* **Edit Feature in Docs**\
  If hosting on ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages, or another platform, allow users to contribute.

Example: GitHubâ€™s `Edit on GitHub` button in ReadTheDocs lets users submit pull requests to improve docs.

***

## 7. **Keep Documentation and Code in Sync**

Your API is a moving target. The worst thing is outdated documentation.

* **Automate Documentation Checks**\
  Use tools like **Spectral** to lint OpenAPI specs for missing descriptions.

* **Run Docs as Part of CI/CD**\
  Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to ensure documentation updates whenever the API changes.

* **Define a Process for Manual Updates**\
  If your OpenAPI spec is auto-generated from code, maintain a **separate guide for non-OpenAPI details**.

***

## Conclusion

Manually documenting an OpenAPI-compliant API is an art and a science. The goal is to balance **automation** and **human-readable insights**. 

### Key Takeaways:
âœ… Use OpenAPI fields (`summary`, `description`, `example`) for inline documentation.  
âœ… Link external Markdown docs for deeper explanations.  
âœ… Leverage tools like **Swagger UI, Redoc, and Stoplight** for rich API documentation.  
âœ… Provide **real-world code samples** in multiple languages.  
âœ… Store docs in **version control** and keep them updated.  
âœ… Enable **user feedback** to improve documentation.  
âœ… Ensure docs **stay in sync with API updates**.

By following these steps, you can ensure your API remains **clear, maintainable, and developer-friendly**!
