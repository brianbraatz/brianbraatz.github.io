One of the **biggest questions** you need to answer when starting an OpenAPI project is:

> **Where does the OpenAPI definition live?**

Or, as we used to say back in the mid-2000s:

> **"Where is your authoritative source?"**

This question is **critical** because **your entire API ecosystem depends on it**.

When I first started using OpenAPI (then called Swagger), I did what many developers still do today:

1. **Set up Swashbuckle** in an ASP.NET Core project.
2. Let it **automatically generate `swagger.json`** based on controllers.
3. Use **NSwag Studio** to generate client proxy classes for consuming the API.

For **internal APIs with a technical audience**, this is **fast, simple, and lean**.

üîπ **Change an API controller?**\
‚û°Ô∏è Swagger updates automatically.

üîπ **Using CI/CD scripts to generate client proxies**\
‚û°Ô∏è If there's a breaking API change, depending on the change something - somewhere will likely fail to build- so you know you broke something

This approach is **great for sensing change**, but is it the best **long-term strategy**?

## üö® The API Design Dilemma: Code-First vs. Design-First

When building APIs, you have two approaches:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Code-First (Generate OpenAPI from Code)**

‚úÖ Use tools like **Swashbuckle** (C#), **FastAPI** (Python), or **SpringDoc** (Java) to generate OpenAPI from controllers.\
‚úÖ API changes automatically reflect in OpenAPI docs.\
‚úÖ Fast and lightweight for internal teams.\
‚ùå API design is **tightly coupled** to the implementation.\
‚ùå No clear API review process before implementation.\
‚ùå Can result in **inconsistent API design** over time.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Design-First (OpenAPI Defines the Code)**

‚úÖ Use **visual tools** like **Stoplight Studio**, **Swagger Editor**, or **Postman** to design APIs.\
‚úÖ The OpenAPI spec becomes the **single source of truth**.\
‚úÖ Code is generated **from OpenAPI** rather than the other way around.\
‚úÖ Encourages **API governance, consistency, and review before implementation**.\
‚ùå Requires **discipline** to keep code in sync.\
‚ùå More upfront effort.

üîë **Key Difference?**

* **Code-First = "Write Code, Docs Follow"**
* **Design-First = "Write API Spec, Code Follows"**

## üõ† Tools for API Design-First Workflows

<!-- 
If you want to **shift left** and make OpenAPI the **source of truth**, you‚Äôll need the right tools.
-->

| Tool                 | Purpose                               | Pros                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Stoplight Studio** | Visual API editor                     | No YAML needed, built-in mocking |
| **Swagger Editor**   | OpenAPI editor in the browser         | Simple, fast, free               |
| **Postman**          | API design & testing                  | Great for team collaboration     |
| **Apicurio**         | API governance & lifecycle management | Ideal for large teams            |

With these tools, **API design comes first**.\
Developers then use the OpenAPI definition to generate **code stubs** instead of letting the code generate OpenAPI.

## üîÑ Code-First vs. Design-First: Pros & Cons

| Feature                       | Code-First (Swashbuckle, NSwag)                 | Design-First (Stoplight, Swagger Editor) |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**                     | ‚úÖ Fast setup                                    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower initial setup                  |
| **Documentation**             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-generated, but not always user-friendly | ‚úÖ Structured, well-documented APIs       |
| **Consistency**               | ‚ùå Can be inconsistent between teams             | ‚úÖ Encourages standardization             |
| **Collaboration**             | ‚ùå Harder to collaborate before implementation   | ‚úÖ API design is reviewed before coding   |
| **Breaking Changes**          | ‚úÖ CI/CD detects breaking changes                | ‚ùå Manual validation required             |
| **Long-Term Maintainability** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can get messy over time                      | ‚úÖ More scalable                          |

## üèó Code-First for Internal APIs, Design-First for Public APIs

So which approach should you use?

üîπ **For internal, tech-focused APIs?**\
‚û°Ô∏è Code-first is **fast** and **good enough** (Swashbuckle + NSwag).

üîπ **For public, customer-facing APIs?**\
‚û°Ô∏è Design-first **ensures consistency, better documentation, and API governance**.

**Hybrid Approach?**\
You can **start with Code-First** and transition to Design-First **as your API grows**.

***

## üî• How to Implement Design-First API Development

If you‚Äôre moving toward **Design-First**, here‚Äôs a solid workflow:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Design the API First**

Use **Stoplight Studio** or **Swagger Editor** to draft the API before coding.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Code Stubs**

Use tools like **NSwag**, **OpenAPI Generator**, or **AutoRest** to generate controllers/models.

Example: Generate C# API controllers:

```sh
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g aspnetcore -o ./output
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Keep API & Code in Sync**

* Validate API updates using **Spectral Linting**:
  ```sh
  spectral lint openapi.yaml
  ```
* Use **contract tests** (like Pact) to verify API behavior.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automate API Documentation**

Deploy OpenAPI docs with **ReDoc** or **Swagger UI**:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/openapi.yaml:/usr/share/nginx/html/openapi.yaml redocly/redoc
```

## üî• Conclusion: Pick Your Source of Truth Wisely

üëâ If **code generates OpenAPI** (Code-First), your API evolves **organically** but may lack consistency.\
üëâ If **OpenAPI defines the code** (Design-First), your API is **structured and governed**, but requires discipline.

For **small, internal APIs**, stick with **Swashbuckle + NSwag**.\
For **public APIs**, shift to **Design-First** with **Stoplight** or **Swagger Editor**.

At the end of the day, the **most important thing** is to **choose your authoritative source** early‚Äîbecause **fixing API design later is painful**. üòÖ
