# Why I Love Windows 95: A Software Developer's Perspective

![Windows 95 Desktop](/post/Articles/IMAGES/windows95desktop.png)

As a software developer who witnessed the evolution of personal computing, Windows 95 holds a special place in my heart.

It wasn't just an operating system.

It was a cultural revolution "thing" that changed software development and the user experience.

Finally an Operating System truely for "the masses"....

## A Brief History of Windows 95

Released on August 24, 1995, Windows 95 was Microsoft's significant leap from the Windows 3.x series.

It modernized the PC experience, making it more user-friendly and powerful for normal people.

The launch was a cultural phenomenon, marked by wild marketing campaigns and media coverage.

## Windows 95 vs. Windows 3.1: A Comparative Analysis

To appreciate the advancements Windows 95 brought, it's essential to compare it with what came before; Windows 3.1.

### User Interface Enhancements

**Windows 3.1** featured the Program Manager and File Manager, which, while functional, were not intuitive for many users. The interface was primarily text-based with limited graphical elements.

**Windows 95**, on the other hand, introduced the iconic **Start Menu** and **Taskbar**, providing a more intuitive and organized way to access applications and manage tasks. This design has endured, with the Start Menu remaining a staple in Windows operating systems to this day.

### Technical Advancements

* **32-bit Architecture**: Windows 3.1 was a 16-bit operating environment, limiting its performance and capabilities. Windows 95 introduced a 32-bit architecture, enhancing performance and allowing for more complex applications.

* **Preemptive Multitasking**: Windows 95 implemented preemptive multitasking, enabling the operating system to manage multiple applications more efficiently than the cooperative multitasking in Windows 3.1.

* **Plug and Play Support**: Setting up hardware in Windows 3.1 often required manual configuration. Windows 95's Plug and Play feature simplified hardware installation, automatically detecting and configuring new devices.

### Networking Capabilities

Networking in Windows 3.1 was cumbersome and required additional software. Windows 95 integrated networking features directly into the operating system, including built-in support for dial-up networking and TCP/IP, laying the groundwork for easier internet access.

You used to have to go "BUY YOUR OWN TC/IP STACK for networking"

That was not fun

and the APIS for it were all for a specific vendor....

(later came Winsock.. thats another idea for an article i may get to someday...)

## Key Features of Windows 95

* **Start Menu and Taskbar**: Simplified navigation and improved workflow.
* **32-bit Architecture**: Enhanced performance and multitasking capabilities.
* **Plug and Play**: Made hardware installation effortless.
* **Internet Explorer Integration**: First steps toward the modern web experience.
* **Better Multitasking**: Improved application handling and stability.

## The Cultural Phenomenon of Windows 95's Launch

The launch of Windows 95 was not just a technological event but a cultural "thing".

### The Rolling Stones and "Start Me Up"

Microsoft licensed The Rolling Stones' song "Start Me Up" for the Windows 95 advertising campaign, a move that was both bold and memorable. The choice of song emphasized the new Start Menu feature and added a rock-and-roll flair to the product's image.

### Jay Leno's Involvement

Comedian Jay Leno was enlisted to host the Windows 95 launch event, adding a touch of entertainment to the proceedings. His presence helped humanize the technology and made the event more accessible to the general public.

### Consumer Anticipation

The anticipation for Windows 95 was palpable. Consumers lined up outside stores, with some even camping overnight, eager to be among the first to experience the new operating system. Retailers like Costco saw their shelves quickly emptied as people rushed to purchase Windows 95.

<!-- 
## Bill Gates and the First Windows 95 Package

In a symbolic gesture, Bill Gates personally handed the first copy of Windows 95 to a customer, marking the beginning of a new era in personal computing.

## Windows 95's Impact on Software Development

For developers, Windows 95 was a game-changer.

### Enhanced Development Environment

For developers like me, Windows 95 was a game-changer.

The shift to a 32-bit architecture allowed us to create more powerful and complex applications.\
We could access more memory, we had a TCIP\IP API (Winsock), and if one app froze or crashed , it didn't (usually) take down the whole OS.

### Improved Graphics and Gaming

Windows 95 brought advancements in graphics , including support for DirectX.

DirectX  became a cornerstone for game development on the platform.

DirectX attracted game developers, leading to a surge in PC gaming.

(Configuration of games in DOS, seriously sucked..)

<!-- 
## Conclusion

Windows 95 was more than just an operating system; it was a transformative force that reshaped the computing landscape. Its innovative features, cultural impact, and enhancements in software development have left a lasting legacy that continues to influence modern computing.
