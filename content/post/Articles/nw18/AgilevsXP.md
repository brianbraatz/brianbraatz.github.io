# Agile vs. XP: A Comparison of Methodologies   -->

Back in 2002, when I first started experimenting with Agile and XP (Extreme Programming), both were gaining traction as trendy approaches to software dev.

At the time, XP was a hot topic, but today, and you don‚Äôt hear much about it anymore.

<!-- So, what happened? And how does XP compare to Agile as we know it today? Let‚Äôs dive in.   -->

***

## **Agile: The Broader Umbrella**

Agile isn‚Äôt a single methodology‚Äîit‚Äôs a philosophy. It emerged in 2001 with the **Agile Manifesto**, which prioritized:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile frameworks (like Scrum, Kanban, and yes, XP) were designed to help teams develop software in a way that‚Äôs flexible, iterative, and customer-focused.

### **Key Characteristics of Agile**

‚úÖ Iterative and incremental development\
‚úÖ Frequent feedback loops\
‚úÖ Emphasis on collaboration (with customers and within teams)\
‚úÖ Adaptability to changing requirements

Agile is like a loose-fitting jacket‚Äîit provides structure but allows for flexibility.

It doesn‚Äôt prescribe specific engineering practices, which is where XP originally came in.

## **Extreme Programming (XP): The Hardcore Engineering Approach**

XP, created by Kent Beck in the late 1990s, was **one of the first Agile methodologies** that defined concrete software engineering practices.

It was **extremely disciplined**‚Äîhence the name‚Äîand aimed to improve software quality while adapting to changing requirements.

### **Key XP Practices**

üîπ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ‚Äì Write tests before writing code.\
üîπ **Pair Programming** ‚Äì Two developers work together at one workstation.\
üîπ **Continuous Integration (CI)** ‚Äì Frequent, automated builds and testing.\
üîπ **Refactoring** ‚Äì Constantly improving code without changing behavior.\
üîπ **Simple Design** ‚Äì No unnecessary complexity.\
üîπ **Small Releases** ‚Äì Frequent, incremental deliveries.\
üîπ **Collective Code Ownership** ‚Äì Any developer can modify any part of the codebase.\
üîπ **40-Hour Workweek** ‚Äì Sustainable pace over burnout.

XP was all about **discipline and technical excellence**, but it had some rigid requirements that not all teams were comfortable with.

From My experience, the thing people tend to talk about the most with XP was the Pair-Programming..

## **Agile vs. XP: Key Differences**

| Feature                | Agile                                     | XP                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**              | Broad philosophy with multiple frameworks | Specific Agile methodology with strict engineering practices |
| **Engineering Focus**  | Encourages but doesn‚Äôt dictate            | Strongly emphasizes coding discipline                        |
| **Management**         | Adapts to various project styles          | Developer-centric, minimal bureaucracy                       |
| **Team Collaboration** | Cross-functional, but varies by framework | Strong developer pairing and collaboration                   |
| **Flexibility**        | High‚Äîdepends on framework                 | Less flexible‚Äîstrict XP rules                                |
| **Adoption Today**     | Still widely used (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe)   | Rare, but some XP practices live on                          |

## **Why I personally think XP Faded**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Rigid Practices**

XP demanded strict adherence to practices like **pair programming** and **TDD**, which some teams found exhausting or impractical.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scrum Took Over**

Scrum, with its simple structure (sprints, stand-ups, retrospectives), was easier for businesses to adopt than XP‚Äôs strict engineering principles.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **XP‚Äôs Best Ideas Were Absorbed**

Even though XP isn‚Äôt commonly used as a full methodology anymore, its best practices‚Äî**TDD, CI/CD, and refactoring**‚Äîare still popular.

And if an occasional tricky problem comes up, Pair programming can be a very useful tool in the tool-box.

<!-- 
## **Final Thoughts**  

If you were developing software in the early 2000s, you probably saw XP as a promising, hardcore engineering methodology. While it may not be the talk of the town anymore, its influence is still deeply embedded in modern Agile development.  

So, was XP a failure? Not at all. It just evolved. **The best parts of XP live on inside Agile teams today.**  

üöÄ **Would I still recommend XP today?** Not as a full methodology, but its practices (TDD, CI, pair programming) remain valuable tools for any development team.

## **Key Ideas Summary**  

| Idea                 | Summary |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Agile Overview**   | A flexible, broad philosophy for software development. |
| **XP Overview**      | A strict Agile methodology focused on technical excellence. |
| **Differences**      | Agile is more flexible; XP is rigid but developer-focused. |
| **XP‚Äôs Decline**     | XP was too rigid, and Scrum became more popular. |
| **XP‚Äôs Legacy**      | Many XP practices are still widely used today. |
