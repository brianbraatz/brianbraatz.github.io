# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 1)** -->

<!-- Welcome to this multi-part series where we dive deep into **Apache Spark** and **PySpark**! If you've ever wondered how to efficiently process **large datasets** or run **distributed computing** on your local machine, you're in the right place. By the end of this series, you'll have Apache Spark up and running on your machine, feeding it local documents (like research papers), and querying them with PySpark. -->

## **What is Apache Spark?**

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing framework designed for big data processing.

It allows you to process massive datasets across multiple nodes while being fast, scalable, and fairly easy to use.

Unlike traditional Hadoop-based solutions, Spark performs most of its operations **in-memory**, making it **100x faster** than MapReduce in certain cases.

### **Key Features of Apache Spark:**

✔ **Lightning Fast:** Thanks to in-memory computation.\
✔ **Distributed Processing:** Runs across multiple machines or locally on your computer.\
✔ **Multi-Language Support:** Supports Python (PySpark), Java, Scala, and R.\
✔ **Integrated Libraries:** Includes tools for SQL, machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and streaming.\
✔ **Easy to Use:** Provides an intuitive API for data manipulation.

## **What is PySpark?**

PySpark is the **Python API for Apache Spark**.

It allows you to leverage the power of Spark while writing Python code.

If you're already comfortable with **pandas**, **NumPy**, or **SQL**, PySpark will feel quite familiar.

### **Why Use PySpark Instead of Just Apache Spark?**

* **Python-Friendly:** Great for those who prefer Python over Scala or Java.
* **Data Science & ML Integration:** Easily integrates with libraries like TensorFlow and pandas.
* **Simplifies Big Data Workflows:** Write concise Python code while Spark does the heavy lifting.

<!-- ## **Series Roadmap**
This is just the beginning! Here’s what you can expect in the next parts of this series:

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 2)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 1**, we introduced Spark, explained why it’s a game-changer for big data, and laid out our roadmap. Now, let’s roll up our sleeves and get **Apache Spark installed on your local machine**.

This guide will cover installation on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. By the end, you’ll have a working Spark setup ready for development. -->

***

## **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before installing Spark, ensure you have:\
✅ **Java (JDK 8 or later)** installed. Run:

```sh
java -version
```

✅ **Python 3.7+** installed. Run:

```sh
python --version
```

✅ **Scala (optional, but useful for Spark development)**:

```sh
scala -version
```

✅ **Ensure your system has at least 8GB RAM** for smooth performance.

***

## **Step 2: Download Apache Spark**

1. Visit the [official Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. Choose the latest **stable release**.
3. Select **Pre-built for Apache Hadoop**.
4. Download the `.tgz` file and extract it.

***

## **Step 3: Install Spark on Windows**

### **1. Extract Spark Files**

Unzip the downloaded file into `C:\spark`.

### **2. Set Environment Variables**

Add the following to your **system environment variables**:

* `SPARK_HOME = C:\spark`
* Add `%SPARK_HOME%\bin` to `PATH`.

### **3. Verify Installation**

Open PowerShell and run:

```sh
spark-shell
```

If Spark starts, the installation is successful!

***

## **Step 4: Install Spark on macOS/Linux**

### **1. Install via Homebrew (macOS only)**

```sh
brew install apache-spark
```

### **2. Manually Extract Spark (Linux & macOS)**

```sh
tar -xvf spark-*.tgz
mv spark-* /opt/spark
```

### **3. Set Environment Variables**

Add these lines to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark
export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Then apply changes:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **4. Verify Installation**

Run:

```sh
spark-shell
```

You should see a Spark REPL session start.

***

## **Step 5: Install PySpark**

If you plan to use Spark with Python, install PySpark via pip:

```sh
pip install pyspark
```

Test PySpark:

```sh
python -c "import pyspark; print(pyspark.__version__)"
```

***

<!-- 
## **Next Steps**
Now that Spark is installed, we’re ready to **load local documents (like research papers) into Spark for analysis**! In **Part 3**, we’ll feed Spark a directory of text files and learn how to interact with them using PySpark.

Stay tuned for the next part! 🚀

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 5)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! By now, you should have **Apache Spark installed on your local machine** (see Part 2).  -->

Now, let’s start working with real data!

Now we will feed Spark a set of local documents (like research papers, articles, or logs) and perform basic data processing with PySpark.

***

## **Step 1: Prepare Your Data**

For this example, we’ll assume you have a directory called `documents/` that contains multiple `.txt` files with research papers or articles.

### **1. Create a Local Dataset**

Make a directory and place some text files in it:

```sh
mkdir ~/spark_documents
cd ~/spark_documents
echo "This is a test document about Apache Spark." > doc1.txt
echo "Another document discussing distributed computing." > doc2.txt
```

Alternatively, download some real research papers in `.txt` format.

***

## **Step 2: Start a PySpark Session**

Open a Python script or Jupyter Notebook and start PySpark:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("DocumentProcessing") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

This initializes **Apache Spark** for processing.

***

## **Step 3: Load Documents into Spark**

Now, we’ll load all text files in the `spark_documents` directory:

```python
document_df = spark.read.text("~/spark_documents/*")
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
```

This will output the first few lines from your documents.

***

## **Step 4: Perform Basic Processing**

Let’s count the number of lines in our documents:

```python
line_count = document_df.count()
print(f"Total number of lines in documents: {line_count}")
```

Or filter lines containing specific words:

```python
spark_words = document_df.filter(document_df.value.contains("Spark"))
spark_words.show()
```

This filters out lines that mention "Spark."

***

## **Step 5: Word Count Example**

One of the most common text-processing examples is **word count**:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import explode, split

words_df = document_df.select(explode(split(document_df.value, " ")).alias("word"))
word_count = words_df.groupBy("word").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
word_count.show(10)
```

This tokenizes the documents, counts word occurrences, and sorts them in descending order.

<!-- ---

## **Next Steps**
We now have Apache Spark processing local text documents! In **Part 6**, we’ll explore **more advanced PySpark operations**, such as **TF-IDF for text analysis** and **structured queries**.

Stay tuned! 🚀

 -->

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 6)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 5**, we loaded local documents and performed **basic text processing** using PySpark.  -->

Now, let's take things up a notch with **advanced text analysis**, including **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **structured queries** with PySpark DataFrames.

## (WHAT!?!?!- Dont worry, we will explain it...)

## **Step 1: Recap – Load Documents into Spark**

Before diving into advanced analytics, let’s ensure we have our document dataset loaded.

Start by launching a **PySpark session**:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("AdvancedTextProcessing") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load text documents into a DataFrame
document_df = spark.read.text("~/spark_documents/*")
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
```

***

## **Step 2: Tokenizing Words (Splitting Text into Words)**

To analyze text, we first **tokenize** it into individual words using Spark’s `split()` function:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import explode, split

words_df = document_df.select(explode(split(document_df.value, " ")).alias("word"))
words_df.show(10)
```

This will break sentences into separate words and list them as rows.

***

## **Step 3: Removing Stopwords**

Common words like "the," "and," or "is" don’t add much meaning to text analysis. We can remove them using PySpark’s built-in **StopWordsRemover**:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import StopWordsRemover

remover = StopWordsRemover(inputCol="word", outputCol="filtered")
filtered_df = remover.transform(words_df)
filtered_df.show(10)
```

This helps in cleaning up the dataset before applying more advanced analytics.

***

## **Step 4: TF-IDF – Identifying Important Words**

### **What is TF-IDF?**

TF-IDF (**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**) is a technique to find important words in documents. It assigns higher scores to words that appear frequently in a document but rarely across all documents.

### **Applying TF-IDF in PySpark**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import HashingTF, IDF

# Convert words into numerical feature vectors
hashing_tf = HashingTF(inputCol="filtered", outputCol="rawFeatures", numFeatures=20)
tf_data = hashing_tf.transform(filtered_df)

# Compute IDF values
idf = IDF(inputCol="rawFeatures", outputCol="features")
idf_model = idf.fit(tf_data)
tf_idf_data = idf_model.transform(tf_data)

# Show TF-IDF scores
tf_idf_data.select("filtered", "features").show(10, truncate=False)
```

Now, Spark assigns importance scores to words, helping us identify **keywords in research papers** or **most relevant terms in documents**.

***

## **Step 5: Structured Queries on Documents**

Since Spark supports SQL, let’s treat our documents like a database and run **SQL queries** on them.

### **Register DataFrame as a Temporary Table**

```python
document_df.createOrReplaceTempView("documents")
```

### **Example Queries:**

Find lines containing "machine learning":

```python
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM documents WHERE value LIKE '%machine learning%'").show()
```

Find the **top words** in documents:

```python
spark.sql("SELECT word, COUNT(*) as count FROM words_df GROUP BY word ORDER BY count DESC").show(10)
```

***

<!-- 
## **Next Steps**
In **Part 7**, we’ll explore **document classification and sentiment analysis** using **PySpark MLlib**. We’ll take what we’ve learned and apply it to **real-world text analytics problems**.

Stay tuned for the next part! 🚀 -->

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 7)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 6**, we explored **advanced text analysis** using **TF-IDF and structured queries**.  -->

Now, let's take it a step further and apply **machine learning to classify documents and analyze sentiment** using **PySpark MLlib**.

***

## **Step 1: Understanding Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis**

### **What is Text Classification?**

Text classification assigns categories (labels) to text documents. Examples include:

* **Spam detection** (spam vs. not spam)
* **News categorization** (politics, sports, technology, etc.)
* **Customer feedback tagging** (positive, negative, neutral)

### **What is Sentiment Analysis?**

Sentiment analysis determines the **emotional tone** of text, typically classifying it as **positive, negative, or neutral**. It is widely used in:

* **Social media monitoring**
* **Product review analysis**
* **Customer support automation**

***

## **Step 2: Preparing the Dataset**

For this tutorial, let’s assume we have a dataset of customer reviews stored as `reviews.csv`:

```csv
review_text,label
"The product is amazing!",positive
"Terrible experience, would not recommend.",negative
"It's okay, not the best but not the worst.",neutral
```

Load the dataset into Spark:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("TextClassification").getOrCreate()

# Load CSV data
reviews_df = spark.read.csv("reviews.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
reviews_df.show()
```

***

## **Step 3: Preprocessing Text Data**

Before training a model, we need to convert text into a numerical format.

### **1. Tokenization**

Splitting sentences into words:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer

tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="review_text", outputCol="words")
reviews_tokenized = tokenizer.transform(reviews_df)
```

### **2. Removing Stopwords**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import StopWordsRemover

remover = StopWordsRemover(inputCol="words", outputCol="filtered_words")
reviews_cleaned = remover.transform(reviews_tokenized)
```

### **3. TF-IDF Feature Extraction**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import HashingTF, IDF

hashing_tf = HashingTF(inputCol="filtered_words", outputCol="rawFeatures", numFeatures=20)
tf_data = hashing_tf.transform(reviews_cleaned)
idf = IDF(inputCol="rawFeatures", outputCol="features")
idf_model = idf.fit(tf_data)
final_data = idf_model.transform(tf_data)
```

***

## **Step 4: Training a Machine Learning Model**

We’ll use **Logistic Regression** for classification.

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

# Convert text labels into numerical values
indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="label", outputCol="labelIndex")
lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="labelIndex")

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[indexer, lr])

# Train-test split
train_data, test_data = final_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Train model
model = pipeline.fit(train_data)
```

***

## **Step 5: Evaluating the Model**

Now, let’s test our model and check the accuracy.

```python
predictions = model.transform(test_data)
predictions.select("review_text", "label", "prediction").show()
```

To measure performance:

```python
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="labelIndex", metricName="accuracy")
accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

***

## **Step 6: Predicting Sentiment on New Text**

To classify new customer reviews:

```python
new_reviews = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("I love this product!",),
    ("Worst purchase ever.",),
    ("Meh, it's alright.",)
], ["review_text"])

new_reviews_transformed = idf_model.transform(hashing_tf.transform(remover.transform(tokenizer.transform(new_reviews))))
new_predictions = model.transform(new_reviews_transformed)
new_predictions.select("review_text", "prediction").show()
```

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 10)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 9**, we discussed **why integrating Spark MLlib, PHI-2, and Llama.cpp** creates a powerful **AI-driven document processing pipeline**. Now, let’s bring it all together with **detailed code examples** to build this system from scratch. -->

<!-- 
---

## **Scenario: AI-Powered Document Processing**
Imagine we have **millions of research papers** stored as **text documents** that need to be:
1. **Loaded into Spark** for distributed processing.
2. **Summarized with PHI-2** to extract key sentences.
3. **Classified and clustered using Spark MLlib**.
4. **Analyzed using Llama.cpp** for AI-driven insights.

---

## **Step 1: Load Documents into Spark**
First, we need to **initialize Spark** and load a dataset of text documents.

### **1.1 Initialize Spark**
~~~python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("AI-Document-Processing") \
    .getOrCreate()
~~~

### **1.2 Load Documents into Spark DataFrame**
Assume our research papers are stored in a directory (`~/research_papers/`).
~~~python
document_df = spark.read.text("~/research_papers/*")
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
~~~
This loads all text files into a single **Spark DataFrame**, where each row is a **line of text** from the documents.

---

## **Step 2: Summarization with PHI-2**
Now, we’ll use **PHI-2** to generate **summaries** for each document.

### **2.1 Install and Load PHI-2**
~~~sh
pip install transformers torch
~~~
~~~python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load PHI-2 model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2")
~~~

### **2.2 Define Summarization Function**
~~~python
def summarize_text(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
    summary_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=100)
    return tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
~~~

### **2.3 Apply Summarization in Spark**
~~~python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

summarize_udf = udf(summarize_text, StringType())
document_df = document_df.withColumn("summary", summarize_udf(document_df.value))
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
~~~

Now each document has a **summary** alongside the full text.

---

## **Step 3: Classification and Clustering with MLlib**
We now feed the **summarized text** into **MLlib** for classification and clustering.

### **3.1 Tokenization and Feature Extraction**
~~~python
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer, HashingTF, IDF

# Tokenize text
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="summary", outputCol="words")
words_df = tokenizer.transform(document_df)

# Convert words into numerical vectors
hashing_tf = HashingTF(inputCol="words", outputCol="rawFeatures", numFeatures=20)
tf_data = hashing_tf.transform(words_df)

idf = IDF(inputCol="rawFeatures", outputCol="features")
idf_model = idf.fit(tf_data)
final_data = idf_model.transform(tf_data)
~~~

### **3.2 Train a Classifier Model**
~~~python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

# Convert text labels into numerical values
indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="summary", outputCol="labelIndex")
lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="labelIndex")

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[indexer, lr])

# Train model
train_data, test_data = final_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)
model = pipeline.fit(train_data)
~~~

Now we have a trained model that can classify **new documents**.

---

## **Step 4: AI-Powered Insights with Llama.cpp**
We’ll now use **Llama.cpp** to generate **human-like insights** from our research papers. -->

<!-- 
### **4.1 Install and Load Llama.cpp**
~~~sh
pip install llama-cpp-python
~~~
~~~python
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Load Llama-2 model
llm = Llama(model_path="llama-2-7b.Q4_K.gguf")
~~~

### **4.2 Define Question-Answering Function**
~~~python
def answer_question(text, question):
    response = llm(f"{text}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:")
    return response["choices"][0]["text"].strip()
~~~

### **4.3 Apply Llama to Extract Insights**
~~~python
answer_udf = udf(lambda text: answer_question(text, "What are the key findings of this paper?"), StringType())
document_df = document_df.withColumn("llama_answer", answer_udf(document_df.summary))
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
~~~

Now, each document has:
✅ **Full text**  
✅ **Summary** (PHI-2)  
✅ **Classification** (MLlib)  
✅ **AI-generated insights** (Llama.cpp)

---

## **Final Thoughts: Why This Pipeline is Powerful**
✅ **Scalability**: Spark distributes workloads across multiple nodes.  
✅ **Efficiency**: PHI-2 compresses and extracts key sentences before MLlib processes them.  
✅ **AI-Powered**: Llama.cpp generates **human-like insights** directly on structured data.  
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Runs locally without relying on expensive cloud services.  

### **Next Steps**
In **Part 11**, we’ll integrate **real-time AI-powered processing** with **Spark Streaming + Llama.cpp** to process live document feeds. Stay tuned! 🚀

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 10)**

Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 9**, we discussed **why integrating Spark MLlib, PHI-2, and Llama.cpp** creates a powerful **AI-driven document processing pipeline**. Now, let’s bring it all together with **detailed code examples** and sample **inputs/outputs** to demonstrate the real-world impact of this approach.

---

## **Example Inputs and Outputs**
We’ll walk through a **sample research paper** and show how each step in our AI-powered pipeline transforms it.

### **Input: Original Research Paper (Stored in Text File)**
~~~txt
Title: Understanding Quantum Computing
Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field that leverages principles of superposition and entanglement to perform computations. Unlike classical computers, which process bits as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use qubits. Recent advancements in quantum error correction have made large-scale quantum computing more feasible.
~~~

---

## **Step 1: Load Document into Spark**

~~~python
document_df = spark.read.text("~/research_papers/*")
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
~~~

### **Spark Output: DataFrame Representation**
| value |
|-------|

| Unlike classical computers, which process bits... |

---

## **Step 2: Summarization with PHI-2**
~~~python
document_df = document_df.withColumn("summary", summarize_udf(document_df.value))
document_df.show(5, truncate=False)
~~~

### **Output: Summarized Text**
~~~txt
Quantum computing utilizes qubits instead of classical bits. Advances in quantum error correction have improved large-scale computing feasibility.
~~~

---

## **Step 3: Classification & Clustering (MLlib)**
~~~python
word_count = document_df.select(explode(split(document_df.summary, " ")).alias("word"))
word_count.groupBy("word").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False).show()
~~~

### **Output: Word Frequency Analysis**
| word | count |
|------|-------|
| quantum | 3 |
| computing | 2 |
| qubits | 1 |

MLlib uses this to classify the document under **"Quantum Computing"** category.

---

## **Step 4: AI Insights with Llama.cpp**

# **Apache Spark and PySpark: A Beginner's Guide (Part 11)** -->

<!-- 
Welcome back to our **Apache Spark and PySpark series**! In **Part 10**, we built an **AI-powered document processing pipeline** that combined **Spark MLlib, PHI-2, and Llama.cpp**.  -->

<!-- Now, we take it to the next level by enabling **real-time processing with Spark Streaming**. This allows us to process incoming document feeds **on the fly**, analyze them, and generate AI-powered insights dynamically.

---

## **Why Use Spark Streaming with Llama.cpp?**
With traditional batch processing, we process a dataset **after** it is fully collected. But what if we want to:
✅ **Analyze news articles in real-time?**  
✅ **Process customer feedback as it arrives?**  
✅ **Run AI-powered insights on live document feeds?**  

Spark Streaming allows us to process **continuous streams of data** and apply AI models like **Llama.cpp for real-time analysis**.

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up Spark Streaming**

### **1.1 Install Required Packages**
~~~sh
pip install pyspark llama-cpp-python transformers torch
~~~

### **1.2 Initialize Spark Streaming**
~~~python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("AI-Streaming-Processing") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Create Streaming Context (batch interval: 5 seconds)
ssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, batchDuration=5)
~~~

---

## **Step 2: Creating a Streaming Data Source**
For this example, we assume **new documents** are arriving in a folder (`~/streaming_documents/`).

### **2.1 Monitor Incoming Files**
~~~python
# Monitor new text files in the directory
document_stream = ssc.textFileStream("file:///home/user/streaming_documents")
~~~

Each time a **new document** is saved in this folder, Spark Streaming **automatically picks it up** and processes it.

---

## **Step 3: Applying AI-Powered Processing**

### **3.1 Summarization with PHI-2**
~~~python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2")

def summarize_text(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
    summary_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=100)
    return tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
~~~

~~~python
document_summaries = document_stream.map(summarize_text)
document_summaries.pprint()
~~~

---

### **3.2 AI Insights with Llama.cpp**
~~~python
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(model_path="llama-2-7b.Q4_K.gguf")

def generate_ai_insight(text):
    response = llm(f"{text}\n\nQuestion: What are the key takeaways?\nAnswer:")
    return response["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

ai_insights = document_summaries.map(generate_ai_insight)
ai_insights.pprint()
~~~

This takes the **real-time streaming documents**, summarizes them with **PHI-2**, and then applies **Llama.cpp** to extract **key insights**.

---

## **Step 4: Running the Streaming Pipeline**
### **4.1 Start Streaming**
~~~python
ssc.start()  # Start the streaming computation
ssc.awaitTermination()  # Wait for the streaming to terminate
~~~

Now, whenever **new text files** appear in `~/streaming_documents/`, they are **processed in real-time**, summarized, and analyzed by AI.

---

## **Example Inputs and Outputs**
### **Incoming Document (Saved in `~/streaming_documents/`):**
~~~txt
