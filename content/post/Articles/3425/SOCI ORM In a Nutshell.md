# SOCI ORM In a Nutshell

If you’ve ever looked at your C++ code and thought, “Wow, managing database queries is like herding cats,” then SOCI might just be your new best friend.

SOCI (pronounced “soh-chee,” like the Russian city) is a lightweight, C++ database access library that acts as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) but still gives you plenty of control. It’s like an ORM but without all the overbearing “let me do everything for you” attitude.

***

## Why Use SOCI?

### 1. It’s Lightweight

Unlike heavyweight ORMs that bloat your application like a fast-food meal, SOCI keeps things simple and efficient.

### 2. It Supports Multiple Databases

SOCI plays nice with a variety of databases, including:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server

### 3. It’s SQL-Friendly

You write actual SQL queries but in a way that’s safe and easy to manage within C++.

### 4. It's Easy to Learn

You don’t need a Ph.D. in ORM theology to use it. A few lines of code, and you’re rolling.

***

## Setting Up SOCI

Before diving in, install SOCI with:

For Debian-based Linux:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libSOCI-dev
```

For macOS using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install SOCI
```

For Windows, you’ll need to build it from source. But hey, you’re a C++ developer—nothing scares you.

***

## Basic Usage

### Connecting to a Database

Let’s start with the most fundamental step: connecting to a database.

```cpp
#include <soci/soci.h>
#include <soci/sqlite3/soci-sqlite3.h>

using namespace soci;

int main() {
    try {
        session sql(sqlite3, "my_database.db");
        std::cout << "Connected to database!" << std::endl;
    } catch (const soci::soci_error &e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Boom! You’re connected to SQLite. Replace `sqlite3` with `postgresql`, `mysql`, or `oracle` to switch databases.

***

## Querying the Database

Now let’s fetch some data. Assume we have a `users` table.

```cpp
std::string name;
int age;
sql << "SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE id = 1", into(name), into(age);

std::cout << "User: " << name << " (" << age << " years old)" << std::endl;
```

Simple, right? No convoluted ORM magic—just a clean and readable query.

***

## Inserting Data

Adding a new user is just as easy:

```cpp
std::string new_name = "Alice";
int new_age = 30;
sql << "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (:name, :age)",
    use(new_name), use(new_age);
```

Placeholders (`:name` and `:age`) keep things safe and prevent SQL injection—because nobody likes a hacked database.

***

## Updating Data

Updating records is a breeze:

```cpp
int user_id = 1;
std::string new_name = "Bob";
sql << "UPDATE users SET name = :name WHERE id = :id",
    use(new_name), use(user_id);
```

SOCI makes SQL feel right at home in C++.

***

## Deleting Data

Deleting a user? No problem:

```cpp
int user_id = 2;
sql << "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = :id", use(user_id);
```

That’s it! Clean and simple.

***

## SOCI vs Other ORMs

Let’s put SOCI head-to-head against some other C++ database solutions:

| Feature             | SOCI | ODB | Qt SQL | Raw SQL |
| ------------------- | ---- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| Lightweight         | ✅    | ❌   | ❌      | ✅       |
| Easy to Use         | ✅    | ❌   | ✅      | ❌       |
| Multiple DB Support | ✅    | ✅   | ✅      | ✅       |
| ORM Features        | ❌    | ✅   | ✅      | ❌       |
| SQL Control         | ✅    | ❌   | ❌      | ✅       |

SOCI is the best of both worlds—structured, safe SQL handling without heavy ORM baggage.

***

<!-- ## Conclusion

SOCI is a fantastic choice if you want lightweight, flexible, and SQL-friendly database handling in C++.

It doesn’t force you into ORM handcuffs but still gives you plenty of ease-of-use features.

So, if you’re tired of bulky frameworks or error-prone raw SQL, give SOCI a shot. Your future self will thank you!
