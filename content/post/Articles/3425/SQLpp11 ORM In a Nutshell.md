# SQL++11 ORM In a Nutshell

So, you've been wrestling with SQL queries in your C++ code, manually handling connections, preparing statements, and juggling result sets like a circus act. Enter `sqlpp11`, the C++ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that makes SQL in C++ less painful and a lot more fun (well, as fun as SQL can get).

In this guide, we’re going to break down `sqlpp11`, how it works, and why you might want to use it.

 <!-- We’ll also throw in some code examples and a comparison table for good measure. Buckle up! -->

***

## What is `sqlpp11`?

`sqlpp11` is a type-safe SQL query library for C++11 and beyond. It’s not exactly a full-blown ORM like Hibernate in Java or Entity Framework in C#. Instead, it provides an intuitive way to construct SQL queries using C++ syntax while maintaining type safety.

The main perks:

* **No more string-based SQL queries** – You can write queries in C++ and let the compiler check them for you.
* **Supports multiple backends** – Works with MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and more.
* **Header-only** – No need to link against a library; just include and go.
* **Composable Queries** – Queries can be built step by step in a clean, functional style.

***

## Installing `sqlpp11`

Before we start writing queries, we need to install `sqlpp11`.

### 1. Install Dependencies

You'll need:

* A C++11-compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
* CMake for building
* Database-specific connectors (e.g., `sqlpp11-connector-mysql` for MySQL)

For example, installing it with MySQL support might look like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```

### 2. Install `sqlpp11`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11.git
cd sqlpp11
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

You'll also need a database-specific connector, such as `sqlpp11-connector-mysql`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11-connector-mysql.git
cd sqlpp11-connector-mysql
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Writing Queries with `sqlpp11`

Let's jump into some code and see how `sqlpp11` helps us avoid SQL injection disasters and runtime query errors.

### Setting Up a Database Connection

```cpp
#include <sqlpp11/sqlpp11.h>
#include <sqlpp11/mysql/mysql.h>
#include "my_database.h" // This is your table definition

int main() {
    sqlpp::mysql::connection_config config;
    config.user = "root";
    config.password = "password";
    config.database = "test_db";

    sqlpp::mysql::connection db(config);
    std::cout << "Connected to MySQL!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Defining a Table

Instead of writing raw SQL table definitions, `sqlpp11` uses C++ structs:

```cpp
#include <sqlpp11/sqlpp11.h>
#include <sqlpp11/table.h>

namespace my_database {
    struct Users : sqlpp::table_t<Users,
        sqlpp::column_t<int, sqlpp::primary_key, sqlpp::auto_increment, sqlpp::not_null>,
        sqlpp::column_t<std::string, sqlpp::not_null>> {
        struct _alias_t { static constexpr const char _literal[] = "users"; };
    };
}
```

### Inserting Data

```cpp
my_database::Users users;
db(insert_into(users).set(users.name = "Alice"));
```

### Querying Data

```cpp
for (const auto& row : db(select(all_of(users)).from(users).where(users.id == 1))) {
    std::cout << "User: " << row.name << std::endl;
}
```

### Updating Data

```cpp
db(update(users).set(users.name = "Bob").where(users.id == 1));
```

### Deleting Data

```cpp
db(remove_from(users).where(users.id == 1));
```
