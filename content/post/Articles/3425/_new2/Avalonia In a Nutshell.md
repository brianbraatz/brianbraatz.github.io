# Avalonia in a Nutshell: A Friendly Guide -->

## What is Avalonia?

Avalonia is what happens when someone looks at WPF and thinks, "What if this could work everywhere?" And by everywhere, I mean Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and even the web.

If that makes you excited, congratulations—you’re officially a UI nerd.

Avalonia is an open-source, cross-platform UI framework for .NET that gives you XAML-based development with a modern twist. It’s basically WPF’s adventurous cousin that doesn’t want to be tied down to Windows.

## A Bit of History

Avalonia started around 2013 with the goal of bringing WPF-like UI development to multiple platforms. Back then, .NET developers were stuck in a weird spot:

* WPF was great, but it was Windows-only.
* Xamarin existed, but making good-looking UIs across multiple platforms was a pain.
* MAUI didn’t exist yet (spoiler: it’s basically Xamarin.Forms 2.0).

Avalonia stepped in with a "hold my coffee" attitude and started delivering a proper, skinnable, and performant cross-platform UI framework.

## Avalonia vs. WPF, Xamarin, and MAUI

| Feature      | Avalonia                                 | WPF                      | Xamarin.Forms                       | MAUI                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Platforms    | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Web | Windows Only             | iOS, Android, UWP (painful styling) | iOS, Android, Mac, Windows          |
| XAML Support | Yes                                      | Yes                      | Yes                                 | Yes                                 |
| Open Source  | Yes                                      | No                       | Yes                                 | Yes                                 |
| Performance  | Good, GPU-accelerated                    | Good, but Windows-only   | Decent, but clunky UIs              | Improved over Xamarin               |
| Styling      | CSS-like, flexible                       | Classic WPF XAML Styling | Limited                             | More flexible but still Xamarin-ish |
| Maturity     | Growing fast                             | Battle-tested            | Mature but dated                    | New-ish (still evolving)            |

In short:

* WPF is rock solid but chained to Windows.
* Xamarin.Forms was kind of like a rushed group project.
* MAUI is Xamarin.Forms 2.0, but still figuring things out.
* Avalonia is clean, fast, and actually fun to use.

## When Should You Use Avalonia Instead of MAUI?

### Use Avalonia if:

* You want true cross-platform desktop and mobile support (including Linux).
* You love WPF but don’t want to be stuck with Windows.
* You want high-performance UI rendering that doesn’t feel sluggish.
* You enjoy modern XAML styling with a CSS-like approach.
* You want something open-source and community-driven.

### Use MAUI if:

* You primarily target mobile (iOS/Android) but also want Windows and Mac support.
* You’re already deep into the Microsoft ecosystem and prefer official support.
* You don’t need Linux or web UI.
* You want something backed directly by Microsoft (even if it’s evolving slowly).

## The Verdict

If you’re building a modern cross-platform app and don’t need heavy Microsoft ecosystem integration, Avalonia is an amazing choice. It’s fast, flexible, and fun to work with.

But if you’re all-in on Microsoft, dealing with mobile apps, and want the "official" framework, then MAUI might be the better fit—just be ready for some growing pains.

Either way, welcome to the world of cross-platform .NET UI frameworks, where "write once, run anywhere" is *almost* true (until you hit that one weird platform bug).
