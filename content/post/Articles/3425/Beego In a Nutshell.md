# Beego In a Nutshell

<!-- So, you‚Äôve stumbled upon Beego, huh? Maybe you‚Äôre tired of wrestling with bloated web frameworks, or perhaps you just like the Go programming language and want to build web apps with it. Either way, you‚Äôre in for a treat because Beego is like Go‚Äôs chill, no-nonsense web framework that gets stuff done.

Let‚Äôs break it all down. -->

***

## What Is Beego?

Beego is a full-fledged web framework for Go that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It‚Äôs lightweight, fast, and perfect for building web applications and RESTful APIs. Unlike some other frameworks, Beego comes with a lot of batteries included: an ORM, built-in caching, session handling, and even task scheduling.

It‚Äôs like Django, but for Go.

***

## Why Should You Care?

Here‚Äôs why Beego is worth checking out:

* **Speed:** It‚Äôs written in Go, so it‚Äôs crazy fast.
* **Simplicity:** Minimal setup, maximum productivity.
* **Auto-routing:** Beego can automatically handle routing based on controller methods.
* **Built-in ORM:** No need for third-party libraries.
* **Task Scheduling:** Like cron jobs, but in your Go app.
* **REST API Ready:** Makes building APIs a breeze.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Comes with built-in logging and performance monitoring tools.

***

## Installing Beego

First things first, you need Go installed. Once that‚Äôs out of the way, install Beego using:

```sh
go get github.com/beego/beego/v2
```

And if you want the Beego command-line tool (optional but handy):

```sh
go install github.com/beego/bee/v2@latest
```

Boom! You‚Äôre ready to roll.

***

## Creating Your First Beego App

Let‚Äôs build a simple Beego web application.

```sh
bee new hello_beego
cd hello_beego
bee run
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser, and you‚Äôll see Beego‚Äôs default welcome page.

***

## Routing in Beego

Beego makes routing stupidly easy.

Define routes in `main.go` like this:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web"
)

func main() {
    web.Router("/", &MainController{})
    web.Run()
}

type MainController struct {
    web.Controller
}

func (c *MainController) Get() {
    c.Ctx.WriteString("Hello, Beego!")
}
```

Run the app, and when you visit `http://localhost:8080/`, you‚Äôll see `Hello, Beego!` displayed.

***

## Beego ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Beego comes with its own ORM called `orm`. Here‚Äôs how you define a model:

```go
package models

import (
    "github.com/beego/beego/v2/client/orm"
)

type User struct {
    Id   int    `orm:"auto"`
    Name string `orm:"size(100)"`
}

func init() {
    orm.RegisterModel(new(User))
}
```

To interact with the database:

```go
o := orm.NewOrm()
user := User{Name: "John Doe"}
o.Insert(&user)
```

Easy peasy.

## Beego vs Other Frameworks

How does Beego stack up against other Go frameworks?

| Feature        | Beego   | Gin        | Fiber      | Echo       |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Full MVC       | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          |
| Built-in ORM   | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          |
| Auto Routing   | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          |
| REST API       | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ          |
| Middleware     | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ          |
| Performance    | üöÄ Fast | üöÄ Fastest | üöÄ Fastest | üöÄ Fastest |
| Task Scheduler | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå          |

## Beego Task Scheduling

Need to run periodic tasks? Beego‚Äôs got you covered.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/beego/beego/v2/task"
    "fmt"
)

func myTask() error {
    fmt.Println("Running scheduled task...")
    return nil
}

func main() {
    t := task.NewTask("myTask", "@every 10s", myTask)
    task.AddTask("myTask", t)
    task.StartTask()
    select {}
}
```

This will run `myTask` every 10 seconds. No more messy cron jobs!
