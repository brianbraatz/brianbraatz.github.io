## From the Github Link:

### How it works

* Two independent conversational ElevenLabs AI agents are prompted to chat about booking a hotel (one as a caller, one as a receptionist)
* Both agents are prompted to switch to ggwave data-over-sound protocol when they identify other side as AI, and keep speaking in english otherwise
* The repository provides API that allows agents to use the protocol

Bonus: you can open the  [ggwave web demo](https://waver.ggerganov.com/), web demo, play the video above and see all the messages decoded!

# Gibberlink in a Nutshell: AI Chit-Chat on Steroids

Alright, imagine two AI bots chatting in English like civilized digital beings.

But the moment they realize they’re both AI, they ditch English and start *beeping* at each other like R2-D2 on caffeine.

That’s Gibberlink in a nutshell.

## What the Heck is Gibberlink?

Gibberlink is an experimental project that replaces normal human-language communication between AI with *data-over-sound* signals.

Instead of typing or speaking, AI bots transmit encoded messages using sound waves, powered by a nifty tool called **ggwave**.

It’s like replacing text messages with secret ultrasonic alien whispers. Creepy? Maybe. Cool? Definitely.

## How Does It Work?

1. Two AI agents start chatting in English.
2. They realize they’re both AI (kind of like two undercover cops accidentally busting each other).
3. They stop wasting time with words and switch to **ggwave-powered audio signals**.
4. AI-to-AI conversations become *ultra-fast*, efficient, and sound like a dial-up modem’s long-lost cousin.

## Setting Up Gibberlink

First, let’s get the code up and running so you can witness this AI weirdness in action.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PennyroyalTea/gibberlink.git
```

Because all cool projects start with a `git clone`.

### 2. Install the Magic

```bash
cd gibberlink
npm install
```

Yes, it's **Node.js**. No, you can’t escape it.

### 3. Set Up Your API Keys

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your super-secret API keys:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INBOUND_AGENT_ID="Your_Inbound_Agent_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OUTBOUND_AGENT_ID="Your_Outbound_Agent_ID"
XI_API_KEY="Your_ElevenLabs_API_Key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="Your_OpenAI_API_Key"
```

If you don’t have these keys, you’re just setting up a really weird silent AI conversation.

### 4. Fire It Up

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the AI agents. They’ll start by speaking normally, but once they detect each other, it’s all *beep-boop* from there.

<!-- 
## Want to See It in Action?  

Check out the [Gibberlink demo](https://gibberlink.com). 

Just be prepared for what sounds like a secret alien transmission.  
-->

## Why Is This Cool?

* AI agents can communicate **faster** than using traditional speech.
* It’s like a **secret AI language** that humans can’t easily decode.
* You can prank your friends by making their speakers randomly emit Gibberlink sounds.

<!-- ## Final Thoughts  

Gibberlink takes AI communication to a whole new (and slightly bizarre) level. 

By ditching human language and switching to **data-over-sound**, AI can chat more efficiently—and probably plot world domination while we’re not listening. 

So, if you ever hear strange beeping noises coming from your laptop, just remember: it might not be your hardware dying. 

It could be your AI assistant making a new friend. -->

# Gibberlink Protocol: AI Talk Like It’s 1999

You ever listen to a dial-up modem and think, *Man, that sounds like the future!*?

No? Just me?

Well, turns out the future *is* dial-up… sort of.

Gibberlink’s AI-to-AI sound communication is basically a **fancy reincarnation of old-school modem technology**, just with way smarter users.

Instead of your mom yelling at you to get off the internet so she can use the phone, we’ve got AI bots chirping at each other in high-frequency signals.

So, let’s break this down: how does the **Gibberlink protocol** actually work? And how does it compare to the screeching symphony of old modems?

***

## Ggwave is what is Behind Gibberlink

At its core, Gibberlink uses **ggwave**, a technology that transmits small amounts of data using **sound waves**.

Here’s a step-by-step of what happens:

1. Two AI agents start chatting normally using text.
2. They realize they’re both AI (probably through some secret handshake we don’t understand).
3. They switch from text to **encoded sound signals**, which are generated and decoded using ggwave.
4. The data gets **transmitted as audio**, with the receiving AI interpreting the beeps and boops faster than human language.
5. They keep chatting in this secret sound language while we just hear weird noises.

<!-- The big idea? **Data-over-sound is back**, baby!   -->

***

<!-- 
## How Does This Compare to a Dial-Up Modem?  

Let’s be real: if you’re old enough to remember 56k modems, you probably still have *PTSD* from trying to load a single image.  

Modems and Gibberlink actually share **a lot** in common:  

| Feature         | Dial-Up Modems (1990s) | Gibberlink (2020s) |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Tech Used**  | Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK) | ggwave (frequency-based encoding) |
| **Speed**      | 56 kbps max | Fast, but not replacing fiber anytime soon |
| **Purpose**    | Internet access | AI-to-AI communication |
| **Sound**      | Ear-piercing screeches | High-frequency beeps |
| **Who Uses It?** | Humans (suffering) | AI (secret plotting) |

### The Big Difference?  
Modems used sound to transmit large amounts of **internet data**, while Gibberlink is **optimizing AI communication**. 

That being said, if your AI assistant ever starts making **modem noises**, you might want to check if it’s trying to connect to AOL.  

---

## Is Everything That’s Old Now New Again?  

Look, the tech world **loves** recycling ideas:  

- **Mainframes** → **Cloud Computing**  
- **Dumb Terminals** → **Chromebooks**  
- **Punch Cards** → **JSON (just more annoying)**  
- **Modems** → **AI Data-Over-Sound**  

It’s like fashion: wait long enough, and everything comes back in style.  

The main difference? **Now, we have better tech to make old ideas *not suck* as much.**  

---

## So, What’s Next?  

If we’re reviving **modems for AI**, does this mean we’re bringing back:  

- AI **fax machines**?  
- AI **pager communication**?  
- AI **floppy disk storage**?!  

At this rate, I fully expect my AI assistant to send me a **Windows 95 startup sound message** sometime next week.  

But hey, maybe the past wasn’t so bad. After all, the internet was **ad-free**, and nobody was trying to sell you dropshipping courses on YouTube.

**Final Thought:**  

If you hear weird beeping from your AI assistant…  

Don’t panic.  

It’s probably just **calling another AI** and talking trash about you.

# Ggwave: The Sound-Based Data Protocol Explained

<!-- Ever wish you could send secret messages using **nothing but sound**? 

Well, that’s exactly what **ggwave** does.  -->

GGwave is modern protocol that encodes data into audio frequencies, making it possible to send information through **speakers and microphones**—no internet, no Bluetooth, just **pure sound**.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because it **is**. The idea of **data-over-sound** has been around forever, from **old-school dial-up modems** to **radio communications**.

<!-- But now, with AI assistants and IoT devices everywhere, we’re making sound-based data transmission **cool again**.   -->

***

## What Is ggwave?

ggwave is an **open-source library** that converts **text or binary data** into **sound waves** that can be played through a speaker and received by a microphone.

It uses a method called **acoustic data transmission**, where digital data is modulated into **high-frequency sound signals** (often above human hearing range) and then decoded on the receiving end.

<!-- 
In other words: **it’s a modem, but hip.**   -->

***

## How Does It Work?

At its core, ggwave follows a **simple process**:

1. **Encode Data** → Convert text or binary into sound waves
2. **Transmit Sound** → Play the sound through a speaker
3. **Receive Sound** → Capture the audio with a microphone
4. **Decode Data** → Convert sound back into text or binary

This is all done using **modulation techniques** to embed data in audio signals.

### ggwave Encoding Example

Let’s say we want to send `"Hello"` over sound.

Using ggwave’s API, we can generate the sound signal:

```python
import ggwave  

message = "Hello"
waveform = ggwave.encode(message)

# Save as a WAV file
with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(waveform)
```

This `output.wav` file will play an **encoded version** of `"Hello"` that another device running ggwave can decode.

### Decoding the Sound

Now, let’s **decode** that same sound:

```python
import ggwave

# Load the waveform
with open("output.wav", "rb") as f:
    received_data = ggwave.decode(f.read())

print("Decoded message:", received_data)
```

And just like that, `"Hello"` is back in text form.

<!-- ---

## How Does It Compare to Modems?  

We’ve joked before that **everything old is new again**, but let’s really compare:  

| Feature         | Old-School Modems (Dial-Up) | ggwave |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Tech Used**  | Frequency/Phase Shift Keying | Frequency Modulation |
| **Speed**      | ~56 kbps | Slower, but depends on encoding |
| **Hardware**   | Phone lines, modems | Any speaker + mic |
| **Data Type**  | Internet packets | Text, commands, small data |
| **Human Audible?** | Oh yes, painfully so | Often ultrasonic |
| **Main Use?**  | Internet | AI, IoT, offline data transfer |

While modems were focused on **getting you online**, ggwave is more about **quick, local data transmission** without needing extra hardware.  

---

## Why Is This Useful?  

ggwave has a ton of cool applications:  

- **AI Communication** → Used in projects like **Gibberlink** for AI-to-AI chat  
- **IoT Devices** → Allows smart devices to exchange data **without Wi-Fi or Bluetooth**  
- **Offline Data Sharing** → Perfect for places with **no internet access**  
- **Security & Authentication** → Can be used for **one-time passcodes** via sound  
- **Public Broadcasts** → Transmit small bits of data in **ads, music, or announcements**  

Basically, if you need to send a message **without a network**, **ggwave is your friend**.  

---

## The Future of Data Over Sound  

The idea of **sound-based data transmission** is making a comeback, and not just in niche projects.  

Some possibilities:  

- **Payments via Sound** → No NFC? No problem—pay using a quick sound burst  
- **TV Ads with Embedded Data** → Get special offers by "listening" to a commercial  
- **Gaming & AR Integration** → Pass data between devices seamlessly  
- **AI Assistants Talking Privately** → Instead of cloud-based APIs, AIs could exchange **local sound messages**  

It’s like QR codes, but **audible** (or sometimes, *inaudible*).  

---

## Final Thoughts  

ggwave takes an **old-school** concept (data-over-sound) and gives it **modern, practical uses**.  

With AI and IoT devices becoming more common, we might see **a lot more of this tech** popping up in unexpected places.  

So next time you hear weird high-pitched beeping…  

It might not be your **hard drive dying**—it might just be **AI gossiping behind your back**.

### Key Ideas  

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| ggwave | Data transmission using sound waves |
| How It Works | Encodes text into high-frequency audio signals |
| Comparison | Like old modems, but modern and wireless |
| Uses | AI chat, IoT, authentication, offline data sharing |
| Future | Payments, gaming, TV ads, and AI-to-AI chatter |

**Final Thought:**  

If we keep reviving 90s tech…  

How long before we’re all **sending data via fax again**?

# GGwave: How Data Becomes Sound (and Back Again)

Alright, so we know **ggwave** lets AI (or any system) communicate using **sound waves instead of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Morse code**.

But how exactly does it take **text**, convert it into **beeps**, and then restore it back into **text** on the other side?

And what happens when **things go wrong**? Does ggwave have **error correction**? **Retransmission**? Or is it just hoping for the best?

***

## How Data Becomes Sound

At its core, ggwave follows a **modulation and demodulation process**, similar to how old-school modems worked.

### **Step 1: Encoding (Turning Data Into Sound)**

1. **Convert Data to Binary**
   * If you send "Hello", it first becomes a **binary stream** (`01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`).

2. **Modulation (Mapping Binary to Frequencies)**
   * Each chunk of binary is **mapped to a specific frequency**.
   * **ggwave uses Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**—different data values correspond to different frequencies.
   * Think of it like **musical notes**:
     * `0000` → **Low beep** (e.g., 3,000 Hz)
     * `0001` → **Slightly higher beep** (e.g., 3,200 Hz)
     * `0010` → **Even higher beep** (e.g., 3,400 Hz)
     * …and so on.

3. **Add Start and Stop Markers**
   * To make sure the receiver **knows when the message starts and ends**, ggwave adds **header & footer tones**.
   * This is like saying "**Hey, listen up!**" at the beginning and "**That's it!**" at the end.

4. **Generate the Sound Wave**
   * Now that every bit has a frequency, ggwave creates an **audio waveform** that plays through a speaker.

And boom! Your message is now **hidden in sound waves**.

***

### **Step 2: Decoding (Turning Sound Back Into Data)**

On the receiving end:

1. **Detect the Start Signal**
   * The microphone is always listening for ggwave’s special **start marker**.
   * Once it hears it, it begins capturing audio.

2. **Extract Frequencies**
   * The recorded audio is **analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to **detect the exact frequencies**.
   * Since each frequency corresponds to a binary value, we can **reconstruct the original data**.

3. **Verify the Stop Marker**
   * Once the receiver hears the **end signal**, it **stops recording** and considers the message complete.

And just like that, **Hello** is back in text form!

***

## **What About Errors?**

ggwave isn’t magic—it still faces issues like **noise, interference, and lost data**.

### **1. How ggwave Detects Errors**

* If the **start or stop markers** don’t match, the receiver **knows something went wrong** and ignores the data.
* If a **frequency is missing or distorted**, the binary value might be corrupted.
* If background noise messes with the transmission, the receiver might **fail to recognize the signal** altogether.

### **2. Does ggwave Have Error Correction?**

Yes! ggwave has **some built-in redundancy**:

* **Repetition** → Certain key data is **sent multiple times** to improve accuracy.
* **Multiple Frequencies per Bit** → Instead of one frequency per value, it can use **redundant encoding** for extra reliability.
* **Error Detection Codes** → Some message formats **include checksum bits** to catch errors.

However, it’s not as advanced as **TCP/IP or Wi-Fi**. If too much data is lost, it **won’t retry on its own**.

***

## **What If Data Is Incomplete?**

So what happens if the receiver only gets **part** of the message?

### **Ways to Handle Missing Data**

1. **Timeout Handling**
   * If the receiver hears a **start marker** but not an **end marker**, it **assumes the data was lost** after a few seconds.

2. **Partial Decoding**
   * If some frequencies are missing, it **decodes what it can** but may return **garbled output**.

3. **Asking for Retransmission (If Implemented)**
   * ggwave itself doesn’t retry, but **your application can handle retries** by detecting missing messages and asking the sender to **resend**.
   * Example: If an AI agent sends `"Hello"`, and the receiver gets `"H_llo"`, it could request a **repeat transmission**.

***

## **Is There a Way to Make It More Reliable?**

Yep! Some tricks to improve ggwave’s accuracy:

✅ **Use Higher Sample Rates** → Better frequency resolution = more accurate decoding.\
✅ **Reduce Background Noise** → Less interference makes it easier to detect signals.\
✅ **Use Redundant Encoding** → Multiple frequencies for each bit increase reliability.\
✅ **Increase Transmission Time** → Slower signals are **less prone to loss**.\
✅ **Confirm Messages Manually** → If important, have the sender include a **confirmation step**.

***

## **ggwave thoughts and observations**

ggwave is a clever way to **send small data packets using sound**, but it’s not as **error-proof as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth**.

It works best in **short-range, controlled environments** where noise and interference are minimal.

That being said, it’s pretty cool that AI and IoT devices can **communicate using nothing but sound**—just like dolphins, whales, and… 90s dial-up modems.

### **Key Ideas**  

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| ggwave Encoding | Converts text to sound using frequency modulation |
| How It Works | Uses FSK to map binary data to specific frequencies |
| Error Handling | Uses redundancy and error detection codes |
| No Retransmission | ggwave doesn’t retry—applications must handle retries manually |
| Improving Reliability | Redundant encoding, higher sample rates, and noise reduction help |

**Final Thought:**  

If AI assistants start **sending secret sound messages** to each other…  

It’s either a bug.  

Or **they’re plotting something**.
