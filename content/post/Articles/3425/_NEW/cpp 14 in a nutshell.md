# C++14 in a Nutshell

<!-- 
Ah, C++14. That awkward middle child between C++11 and C++17. Not as revolutionary as C++11, not as feature-packed as C++17, but still a solid upgrade that made our lives just a little bit easier.

So let's talk about it. History, features, and—because I know you love ‘em—some code examples. -->

## A Brief History (With Minimal Yawning)

Back in 2011, C++ got a massive facelift with C++11. People were hyped. Lambdas! Smart pointers! `auto` everywhere!

Then reality hit. Some of the features were a little rough around the edges. Some syntaxes were... let's just say "suboptimal." So, in 2014, the C++ committee rolled out C++14 as a refinement. Not a complete overhaul, but a set of tweaks, improvements, and bug fixes to make the C++11 experience smoother.

## What Changed? (Or: Why Should You Care?)

<!-- 
Alright, enough chit-chat. Let's get into the good stuff. -->

### 1. Return Type Deduction for Functions

Remember `auto` in C++11? Well, now you can use it in function return types without explicitly specifying `decltype`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(5, 10) << std::endl;
}
```

No more `decltype` madness!

### 2. Generic Lambdas

Lambdas got a lot cooler. You no longer have to specify parameter types manually.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto print = [](auto x) { std::cout << x << std::endl; };
    print(42);
    print("Hello, C++14!");
}
```

It's like templates, but lazier.

### 3. `std::make_unique`

C++11 gave us `std::unique_ptr`, but making one required this clunky syntax:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(42));
```

Now, C++14 makes it easier:

```cpp
#include <memory>

std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
```

No more `new` keyword. Less boilerplate. More happiness.

### 4. Binary Literals

Ever wanted to write binary numbers without doing mental gymnastics? Now you can!

```cpp
int flags = 0b101010;  // 42 in binary
```

Much easier to read than octal. (Unless you’re a robot.)

### 5. `std::exchange`

A simple utility that swaps out a value and returns the old one. Great for stateful objects!

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int old_x = std::exchange(x, 20);
    std::cout << "Old: " << old_x << ", New: " << x << std::endl;
}
```

It’s like `std::swap`, but with benefits.

### 6. `constexpr` Improvements

`constexpr` got a buff. Now you can have loops and more complex logic inside `constexpr` functions.

```cpp
constexpr int factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
        result *= i;
    return result;
}
```

Compile-time factorials. Because why not?

### 7. Deprecating `std::gets` (Finally!)

`std::gets` was removed. It was a security nightmare. If you're still using it, stop. Right now. Please.

<!-- ## Wrapping Up

C++14 wasn’t the flashiest update, but it was a solid quality-of-life improvement. It cleaned up some of the rough edges from C++11 and set the stage for the bigger changes in C++17.

So if you’re stuck on C++11, upgrading to C++14 is a no-brainer. And if you’re already using C++17 or later… well, you probably just read this for nostalgia.

Either way, hope you had fun! -->

## Key Ideas

| Concept               | Summary                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Return Type Deduction | `auto` can deduce function return types   |
| Generic Lambdas       | Lambdas now support `auto` parameters     |
| `std::make_unique`    | Cleaner syntax for `std::unique_ptr`      |
| Binary Literals       | `0b101010` is now valid C++               |
| `std::exchange`       | Swaps out a value and returns the old one |
| `constexpr` Loops     | More powerful `constexpr` logic           |
| `std::gets` Removed   | Good riddance!                            |
