# PyTorch in a Nutshell

## Introduction: What’s the Big Deal with PyTorch? -->

Once upon a time, deep learning was like a mysterious black box that only wizards (also known as researchers) could understand.

Frameworks like TensorFlow ruled the land, but they were a bit, well, complicated.

Then, one day in 2016, the wizards at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) unleashed **PyTorch**—a deep learning framework that was dynamic, Pythonic, and, dare I say, fun to use.

PyTorch made neural networks more like playing with Lego bricks rather than assembling a spaceship with a 500-page manual.

If you love Python and hate wrestling with weird syntax, PyTorch was (and still is) a breath of fresh air.

## History and Motivation

Before PyTorch, we had **Torch**, a powerful machine learning framework written in Lua (yes, Lua—because that’s what the cool kids were using).

Torch was great, but Lua wasn’t exactly the most popular language.

Meanwhile, TensorFlow had already taken off, but many researchers found it frustrating to use because of its static computation graph (ugh, so rigid!).

Then, PyTorch entered the scene, keeping the best parts of Torch while ditching Lua for Python. It introduced **dynamic computation graphs**, making it easy to debug and experiment with neural networks on the fly. It was love at first import.

## Getting Started with PyTorch

Let’s get our hands dirty! First, you’ll need to install PyTorch:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

And now, let’s check if everything is working:

```python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```

If you see a version number, congratulations! You’re officially in the PyTorch club.

## Tensors: The Foundation of PyTorch

At its core, PyTorch is all about **tensors**, which are like NumPy arrays but way cooler because they can run on GPUs.

Creating a simple tensor:

```python
import torch
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(x)
```

Want a random tensor? No problem:

```python
rand_tensor = torch.rand(3, 3)
print(rand_tensor)
```

Need one on a GPU? Easy:

```python
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], device=device)
print(x)
```

## Autograd: The Magic Behind Gradients

PyTorch’s **autograd** module automates gradient computation. Let’s see it in action:

```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2

y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # Should print 4.0 (dy/dx = 2x at x=2)
```

Boom! No need to manually compute derivatives—PyTorch does it for you.

## Building a Neural Network in PyTorch

Let’s create a simple **feedforward neural network** using `torch.nn`:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 3)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(3, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN()
print(model)
```

## Training a Model in PyTorch

Here’s a full training loop:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

dataset = [(torch.tensor([0.5, 1.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))]
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)

model = SimpleNN()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    for data, target in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = F.mse_loss(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

## Using GPUs for Speed

To run your model on a GPU:

```python
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model.to(device)
```

Now, every tensor you create needs to be on the same device:

```python
data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
```

## Saving and Loading Models

After all that training, let’s save the model:

```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")
```

To load it:

```python
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
```

## Deploying PyTorch Models

PyTorch models can be exported to **TorchScript** for production:

```python
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)
scripted_model.save("model_scripted.pt")
```

This makes it easier to deploy in a production environment.

<!-- 
## Conclusion

PyTorch is an incredibly powerful and flexible deep learning framework that makes research, experimentation, and production easier. Whether you’re a researcher, an engineer, or just a curious coder, PyTorch is one of the best tools to have in your arsenal.

If you haven’t already, dive into PyTorch and start building cool AI models. Who knows? Maybe you’ll train a neural network that finally understands why cats love sitting on keyboards. -->
