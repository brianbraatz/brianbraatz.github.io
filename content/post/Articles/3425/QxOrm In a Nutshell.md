# QxOrm In a Nutshell

## What is QxOrm?

Alright, let's talk **QxOrm**—because, let's be honest, setting up a C++ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) without losing your mind is no small feat.

QxOrm is basically the **ORM library for Qt developers** who are tired of writing endless SQL queries. It's designed to bridge the gap between C++ objects and relational databases (like MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) while also throwing in some serialization, reflection, and even JSON support.

In short, it's like having a Swiss Army knife for C++ database development, but without the risk of accidentally cutting yourself.

***

## Why Use QxOrm?

So why bother with **QxOrm** when you could just manually write SQL like a caveman?

* **Less Boilerplate** – Define your C++ models and let QxOrm handle the SQL generation.
* **Qt Integration** – Plays nicely with the Qt framework.
* **Multi-Database Support** – Works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
* **Serialization Support** – JSON, XML, and binary formats out of the box.
* **Reflection System** – No need for tedious getters/setters.
* **Batch Operations** – Fetch thousands of rows in one go.

Basically, it makes your life easier if you’re working in C++ with databases.

***

## Installation

Before we dive into the magic, let's get this thing installed.

### Step 1: Download QxOrm

You can grab **QxOrm** from its [official website](https://www.qxorm.com/) or clone it directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/QxOrm/QxOrm.git
```

### Step 2: Add QxOrm to Your Project

Make sure you have **Qt installed**, then simply include QxOrm in your project:

```cpp
#include <QxOrm.h>
```

That’s it. No crazy dependencies or magic rituals required.

***

## Basic Example

### Defining a Model

Let's create a simple **User** model and map it to a database table.

```cpp
#include <QxOrm.h>

class User
{
public:
    long id;
    QString name;
    int age;
    
    User() : id(0), age(0) {}
    User(long _id, QString _name, int _age) : id(_id), name(_name), age(_age) {}
};

QX_REGISTER_HPP_QX_USER(User, qx::trait::no_base_class, 1)
```

### Registering the Model

Now, let's tell **QxOrm** how this model maps to a database table:

```cpp
QX_REGISTER_CPP_QX_USER(User)
namespace qx
{
    template <> void register_class(QxClass<User> & t)
    {
        t.id(&User::id, "id");
        t.data(&User::name, "name");
        t.data(&User::age, "age");
    }
}
```

### Saving Data to the Database

```cpp
QSqlDatabase db = QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QSQLITE");
db.setDatabaseName("my_database.db");
db.open();

QxSession session;
User u(1, "Alice", 30);
session.save(u);
```

### Fetching Data

```cpp
QVector<User> users;
qx::dao::fetch_all(users);
for (const auto & user : users)
{
    qDebug() << "User:" << user.name << "Age:" << user.age;
}
```

## Comparison: QxOrm vs Other C++ ORMs

| Feature       | QxOrm | SOCI | ODB | Poco Data |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | --- | --------- |
| Qt Support    | ✅     | ❌    | ❌   | ❌         |
| Reflection    | ✅     | ❌    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Multi-DB      | ✅     | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Serialization | ✅     | ❌    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Ease of Use   | 😊    | 😐   | 😓  | 😏        |

As you can see, **QxOrm** is the go-to option if you're using **Qt** and want something with powerful reflection and serialization features.

***

## Advanced Features

### JSON Support

Want to convert your C++ object into JSON? No problem!

```cpp
QVariant json = qx::serialization::to_variant(user);
qDebug() << json;
```

### Bulk Operations

Need to insert a **ton** of records at once? Do this:

```cpp
std::vector<User> bulkUsers = { {1, "Alice", 30}, {2, "Bob", 25} };
qx::dao::insert(bulkUsers);
```

### Transactions

If you need to **commit or rollback**, use transactions:

```cpp
QxSession session;
session.begin();
session.save(user);
session.commit();
```

***

## Wrapping Up

QxOrm is a **lifesaver** for Qt-based C++ database applications. It simplifies database operations, reduces boilerplate, and makes working with C++ a little less painful (which is saying something).

So, if you're working in Qt and need an ORM, **QxOrm is your new best friend**. Give it a shot, and let it handle the database headaches for you!
