# Azure Storage Queues in a Nutshell ‚Äì With Code Examples

Ever feel like your app is a little *too* eager to do everything at once? Like a toddler who drank a double espresso?

That‚Äôs where **Azure Storage Queues** come in. They‚Äôre like the chill older sibling who says, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs handle this one thing at a time.‚Äù

<!-- In this article, we‚Äôll break down what Azure Storage Queues are, why they matter, and how to use them with hands-on code examples. Whether you're building microservices, decoupling monoliths, or just tired of spaghetti code, queues are here to help. -->

***

## üöÄ What Are Azure Storage Queues?

Azure Storage Queues are part of the **Azure Storage Account** family and provide simple, reliable **message queueing** for massive scale.

### ‚úÖ Key Concepts

* **Message**: A string (up to 64 KB) you put in the queue.
* **Queue**: A storage container for messages.
* **Producer**: Sends messages to the queue.
* **Consumer**: Pulls messages from the queue and processes them.

Use cases include:

* Decoupling front-end and back-end processes
* Asynchronous task processing
* Load leveling during spikes
* Retry and resiliency mechanisms

***

## üß™ Getting Started ‚Äì Prerequisites

You‚Äôll need:

* An **Azure Storage Account**
* `.NET 6+` SDK (though older versions will also work fine)
* NuGet package: `Azure.Storage.Queues`

Install it with:

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Queues
```

***

## üéØ Creating and Sending Messages

Here‚Äôs how to create a queue and send a message.

```csharp
using Azure.Storage.Queues;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        string connectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=youraccount;AccountKey=yourkey;";
        string queueName = "orders";

        QueueClient queueClient = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);
        await queueClient.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

        if (queueClient.Exists())
        {
            string message = "New Order: #1234";
            await queueClient.SendMessageAsync(message);
            Console.WriteLine("Message sent!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Boom!** You‚Äôve got a message in your queue.

***

## üì• Receiving Messages

Now let's receive and process that message:

```csharp
var receivedMessage = await queueClient.ReceiveMessageAsync();

if (receivedMessage.Value != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received: {receivedMessage.Value.MessageText}");

    // Delete after processing
    await queueClient.DeleteMessageAsync(
        receivedMessage.Value.MessageId,
        receivedMessage.Value.PopReceipt);
}
```

Important: If you don‚Äôt delete the message, it will reappear after a visibility timeout!

***

## ‚è≥ Message Lifecycle and Visibility Timeout

When a message is read, it becomes **invisible** for a default time (30 seconds). This prevents other consumers from processing the same message.

You can customize this:

```csharp
await queueClient.SendMessageAsync("Hello!", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)); // Delay visibility
```

Or when retrieving:

```csharp
await queueClient.ReceiveMessageAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45)); // Keep it hidden longer
```

***

## üîÑ Updating Messages (Bonus Trick)

You can also update a message‚Äôs content without removing it:

```csharp
await queueClient.UpdateMessageAsync(
    messageId: msg.MessageId,
    popReceipt: msg.PopReceipt,
    messageText: "Updated Content",
    visibilityTimeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
```

Useful for retry logic or marking the message with progress.

***

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Poison Messages

If something keeps failing (e.g. bad data), you don‚Äôt want it retrying forever.

Use a **Dequeue Count** check:

```csharp
if (msg.DequeueCount > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Poison message detected!");
    // Send to dead-letter queue or alert
}
```

There‚Äôs no native dead-letter queue in Storage Queues (unlike Service Bus), so you'll have to roll your own.

***

## üõ†Ô∏è Queue Management

Need to peek at messages without dequeuing?

```csharp
var peeked = await queueClient.PeekMessageAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Peeked: {peeked.Value.MessageText}");
```

Check the number of messages waiting:

```csharp
var props = await queueClient.GetPropertiesAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Approximate message count: {props.Value.ApproximateMessagesCount}");
```

Delete the entire queue when you're done:

```csharp
await queueClient.DeleteIfExistsAsync();
```

***

## üßµ Parallel Processing with Multiple Consumers

Have multiple workers pull from the queue to speed things up:

```csharp
Parallel.For(0, 5, async i =>
{
    var message = await queueClient.ReceiveMessageAsync();
    if (message.Value != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Worker {i} got: {message.Value.MessageText}");
        await queueClient.DeleteMessageAsync(message.Value.MessageId, message.Value.PopReceipt);
    }
});
```

This is an easy way to scale horizontally when you‚Äôve got lots of messages flying around.

## üÜö Storage Queues vs. Service Bus Queues

| Feature             | Storage Queue   | Service Bus Queue                 |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Max message size    | 64 KB           | 256 KB (Standard), 1 MB (Premium) |
| Dead-letter support | ‚ùå Manual        | ‚úÖ Built-in                        |
| FIFO guarantees     | ‚ùå (best effort) | ‚úÖ                                 |
| Delivery semantics  | At least once   | At least once / Exactly once      |
| Protocol            | HTTP/HTTPS      | AMQP, HTTPS                       |
| Cost                | Cheaper         | More features, higher cost        |

If you're building something mission-critical with strict ordering and dead-letter needs, go with **Service Bus**.

But if you want cheap, fast, and simple ‚Äî **Storage Queues** are your best friend.

***

## üßΩ Wrapping It Up

Azure Storage Queues are a lightweight, cost-effective way to handle asynchronous workflows, decouple components, and handle high loads gracefully.

They‚Äôre the duct tape of distributed systems ‚Äî not always flashy, but incredibly useful.
