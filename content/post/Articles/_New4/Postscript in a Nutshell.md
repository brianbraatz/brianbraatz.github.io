# Deep Dive into the PostScript Language

So, you want to dive deep into PostScript, huh? Well, buckle up, because we’re about to take a trip down memory lane—back to the days when Steve Jobs was young, Xerox ruled the tech world, and printers needed a PhD to print a simple document.

## A Brief History of PostScript

PostScript is the reason why your printer doesn't just spit out garbled nonsense when you send it a PDF. It was created in the early 1980s by **Adobe Systems**, founded by former Xerox employees **John Warnock** and **Charles Geschke**.

Here’s how it all connects:

* **Xerox PARC** developed much of the technology that led to PostScript, but they famously fumbled the ball (again) and let Adobe run with it.
* **Apple** and Steve Jobs saw the potential, licensing PostScript for the **LaserWriter** in 1985—this was the first laser printer to include PostScript.
* **Adobe made bank**, and PostScript became the industry standard for printing and desktop publishing.
* **PDF (Portable Document Format)** is basically a direct descendant of PostScript, designed for documents that need to be displayed consistently across devices.

## How PostScript Works

PostScript is a **Turing-complete** programming language. That’s right! Your printer is basically a tiny computer running a programming language.

It's a **stack-based language**, similar to **Forth** or **RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)** calculators. Commands (called "operators") manipulate a stack, meaning **order matters**.

### Example 1: Basic Stack Manipulation

```postscript
10 20 add
```

* `10` and `20` are pushed onto the stack.
* `add` pops them off, adds them, and pushes the result (`30`) back onto the stack.

***

## Debugging PostScript

PostScript is not the friendliest language to debug, but here’s how you can do it without wasting paper:

### 1. Use Ghostscript

[Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) is your best friend for running and debugging PostScript files on your computer.

Run a PostScript file with:

```sh
gs myfile.ps
```

### 2. Debugging with `==` and `print`

* `==` prints the top of the stack.
* `print` prints a string.

Example:

```postscript
(Hello, PostScript!) print
```

***

## Testing PostScript Files Without Printing

If you don’t want to hear your printer scream in agony while testing, use:

1. **Ghostscript**
2. **PostScript viewers** like **GSView** or **MuPDF**
3. **Converting PostScript to PDF** using:
   ```sh
   ps2pdf myfile.ps myfile.pdf
   ```

## Essential PostScript Commands with Examples

| Command        | Description                            | Example                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `moveto`       | Moves the pen to a position            | `100 100 moveto`          |
| `lineto`       | Draws a line from the current position | `200 200 lineto`          |
| `stroke`       | Renders the drawn path                 | `stroke`                  |
| `fill`         | Fills a shape                          | `fill`                    |
| `show`         | Prints text                            | `(Hello!) show`           |
| `setlinewidth` | Sets line thickness                    | `5 setlinewidth`          |
| `setrgbcolor`  | Sets color (RGB)                       | `1 0 0 setrgbcolor` (red) |

### Example: Drawing a Red Line

```postscript
newpath
100 100 moveto
200 200 lineto
1 0 0 setrgbcolor
5 setlinewidth
stroke
showpage
```

### Example: Drawing a Rectangle

```postscript
newpath
100 100 moveto
200 100 lineto
200 200 lineto
100 200 lineto
closepath
stroke
showpage
```

### 1. Drawing a Circle

```postscript
newpath
200 200 50 0 360 arc
stroke
showpage
```

This draws a circle with a radius of 50 centered at (200, 200).

### 2. Drawing a Triangle

```postscript
newpath
100 100 moveto
200 300 lineto
300 100 lineto
closepath
stroke
showpage
```

Simple triangle with three points connected.

### 3. Rotating an Object

```postscript
gsave
200 200 translate
45 rotate
0 0 moveto
100 0 lineto
stroke
grestore
showpage
```

This rotates a line by 45 degrees.

### 4. Scaling an Object

```postscript
gsave
2 2 scale
100 100 moveto
200 100 lineto
stroke
grestore
showpage
```

Doubles the size of a line.

### 5. Setting a Custom Font and Printing Text

```postscript
/Times-Roman findfont
24 scalefont
setfont
100 400 moveto
(Hello, PostScript!) show
showpage
```

Uses Times-Roman font at 24pt size.

### 6. Drawing a Star

```postscript
newpath
100 200 moveto
150 50 lineto
200 200 lineto
50 100 lineto
250 100 lineto
closepath
stroke
showpage
```

Five lines creating a simple star.

### 7. Creating a Gradient Effect

```postscript
0 0 0 setrgbcolor
0 0 moveto
300 0 lineto
300 300 lineto
0 300 lineto
closepath
1 0 0 setrgbcolor
fill
showpage
```

Fills a square with a red color.

### 8. Making a Dashed Line

```postscript
[4 2] 0 setdash
100 100 moveto
300 100 lineto
stroke
showpage
```

Creates a dashed line with a repeating pattern of 4 pixels on, 2 pixels off.

### 9. Clipping an Area

```postscript
newpath
100 100 moveto
200 100 lineto
200 200 lineto
100 200 lineto
closepath
clip
newpath
50 50 moveto
250 250 lineto
stroke
showpage
```

Restricts drawing to a clipped square area.

### 10. Using Loops to Draw Multiple Lines

```postscript
/square {
  newpath
  0 0 moveto
  50 0 lineto
  50 50 lineto
  0 50 lineto
  closepath
  stroke
} def

100 100 translate

5 {
  square
  10 10 translate
} repeat

showpage
```

Draws five squares in a row using a loop.

## Key Takeaways

* **PostScript is a programming language** used for printing.
* **It’s stack-based**, meaning operations work in a last-in, first-out manner.
* **It’s the ancestor of PDF**, still used in professional printing.
* **You can test PostScript without a printer** using Ghostscript and viewers.
* **It has a ton of commands**, but at its core, it’s all about moving pens and drawing shapes.

## PostScript vs. HP's PCL: The Printer Wars

If you’ve ever dealt with printers, you might have heard about **PCL (Printer Command Language)**, which is **HP’s answer to PostScript**. These two have been battling it out in the printing world for decades.

### A Brief History of Postscript vs PCL

* **PostScript (Adobe)** was introduced in the 1980s and became the standard for high-end professional printing.
* **PCL (HP)** was developed by **Hewlett-Packard** in 1984 as a simpler, more efficient alternative to PostScript for personal and office printers.
* **The difference?** PostScript is **device-independent**, meaning it produces the same output no matter the printer, while PCL is **faster but more hardware-dependent**.

### Key Differences Between PostScript and PCL

| Feature                 | PostScript                    | PCL                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Developer**           | Adobe                         | HP                                       |
| **Device Independence** | Yes                           | No                                       |
| **Complexity**          | More complex                  | Simpler                                  |
| **Speed**               | Slower (interpreted language) | Faster (directly understood by printers) |
| **Graphics Quality**    | High precision                | Faster but less precise                  |
| **Usage**               | High-end printing, publishing | General office printing                  |

### Why PostScript Still Matters

Even though PCL is often used in office printers due to speed and simplicity, PostScript **remains the king** for **graphic designers, publishers, and high-quality printing**. If you're printing a complex PDF or a detailed image, PostScript will ensure it looks the same on any printer.

So, which one should you use? **If you just need fast text printing, PCL is great. If you want perfect graphics and consistency, PostScript wins every time.**
