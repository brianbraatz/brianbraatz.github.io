# SED in a Nutshell

## Introduction

Ah, `sed`. The little text-processing tool that has been around since dinosaurs roamed the early UNIX systems. If you've ever found yourself drowning in a sea of text files, manually editing each one like some kind of medieval scribe, then `sed` is about to become your best friend.

SED stands for **Stream Editor**. It’s a command-line tool for parsing and transforming text. Think of it as "Find and Replace" on steroids—except instead of clicking buttons, you're wielding the power of regular expressions like a wizard.

## This article will take you through a whirlwind tour of `sed`, from its history to common use cases.

## A Brief History of `sed`

`sed` was created in 1973 by **Lee E. McMahon** at Bell Labs as part of early UNIX development. It was inspired by the `ed` text editor (hence the name **S**tream **ED**itor). Unlike `ed`, which was interactive, `sed` was designed to process text automatically, making it perfect for scripting and automation.

Fast forward a few decades, and `sed` has become a staple of **Linux**, **macOS**, and other UNIX-like operating systems. It's so ingrained in UNIX culture that if you don’t know `sed`, they don’t even let you into the secret sysadmin club (kidding… mostly).

For the history buffs, here’s the Wikipedia page on `sed`:\

## Why Use `sed`?

So why should you care about `sed`? Because:

* **It’s fast**: `sed` can process large files in milliseconds.
* **It’s scriptable**: Perfect for automation and batch processing.
* **It’s regex-powered**: Regular expressions let you manipulate text like a sorcerer.
* **It saves time**: No more manually editing files.

Basically, if you work with text files, logs, or configuration files, `sed` can make your life easier.

***

## `sed` Syntax Basics

Before we dive into examples, let’s break down the basic `sed` syntax:

```sh
sed 's/old-text/new-text/g' filename
```

* `s` → Stands for **substitute**.
* `old-text` → The text to find.
* `new-text` → The text to replace it with.
* `g` → **Global**, meaning replace all occurrences in a line.
* `filename` → The file to process.

Let’s see it in action:

```sh
echo "I love Vi" | sed 's/Vi/Vim/'
```

Output:

```
I love Vim
```

Boom. Just like that, history is corrected.

## Common `sed` Use Cases

### 1. **Replacing Text in a File**

```sh
sed -i 's/cat/dog/g' animals.txt
```

Replaces every instance of "cat" with "dog" in `animals.txt`.

### 2. **Deleting Lines**

```sh
sed '3d' file.txt
```

Deletes the **third** line from `file.txt`.

```sh
sed '/error/d' logs.txt
```

Deletes all lines containing the word "error" in `logs.txt`.

### 3. **Printing Specific Lines**

```sh
sed -n '5p' file.txt
```

Prints **only** the **5th** line.

```sh
sed -n '10,20p' file.txt
```

Prints lines **10 to 20**.

### 4. **Insert Text at the Beginning of a Line**

```sh
sed 's/^/Hello: /' names.txt
```

Adds "Hello: " to the beginning of each line.

### 5. **Insert Text at the End of a Line**

```sh
sed 's/$/ Goodbye!/' greetings.txt
```

Adds "Goodbye!" to the end of each line.

### 6. **Replace Only on a Specific Line**

```sh
sed '3s/apple/orange/' fruits.txt
```

Replaces "apple" with "orange" **only on line 3**.

### 7. **Replace Multiple Words**

```sh
sed -e 's/dog/cat/g' -e 's/bird/fish/g' animals.txt
```

Replaces "dog" with "cat" **and** "bird" with "fish" in one command.

### 8. **Remove Blank Lines**

```sh
sed '/^$/d' file.txt
```

Deletes all **empty lines**.

### 9. **Find & Replace Using Regex**

```sh
sed 's/[0-9]\+/###/g' numbers.txt
```

Replaces all **numbers** with "###".

### 10. **Convert Lowercase to Uppercase**

```sh
sed 's/[a-z]/\U&/g' text.txt
```

Changes all lowercase letters to uppercase.

## Combining `sed` with Other Commands

Since `sed` is a UNIX command, you can **chain it with other tools**:

### 1. **Using `sed` with `grep`**

```sh
grep "error" logs.txt | sed 's/error/ERROR/g'
```

Finds "error" lines in `logs.txt` and replaces "error" with "ERROR".

### 2. **Using `sed` with `awk`**

```sh
awk '{print $2}' data.txt | sed 's/foo/bar/g'
```

Extracts the second column from `data.txt` and replaces "foo" with "bar".

### 3. **Using `sed` in Scripts**

```sh
#!/bin/bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' fruits.txt > new_fruits.txt
```

Runs `sed` inside a Bash script.

***

## Wrapping Up

`sed` is a powerhouse tool that every Linux/UNIX user should master. Whether you’re editing config files, processing logs, or just having fun replacing words, `sed` has got your back.

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now know more `sed` than most people ever will. Go forth and automate!
