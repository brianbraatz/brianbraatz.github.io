# Understanding How to Leverage SharePoint in ASP.NET 8 Applications: What It‚Äôs Good For and What It‚Äôs Not

If you‚Äôve ever thought, ‚ÄúHey, SharePoint looks fancy, maybe I should use it in my ASP.NET 8 app‚Äù ? 

SharePoint can be an excellent tool for document management, collaboration, and workflow automation‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not a magic wand that fixes everything. 
-->

<!-- 
In this article, we‚Äôll break down:

- **What SharePoint is good for**
- **What it‚Äôs not good for**
- **How to integrate it into your ASP.NET 8 application**
- **Code samples to save you time and frustration**

Let‚Äôs dive in!

<!-- 
## üöÄ Why Integrate SharePoint With ASP.NET 8?

SharePoint isn‚Äôt just a glorified file storage system. Here‚Äôs where it shines:

‚úÖ **Document Management** ‚Äì Upload, retrieve, and organize documents with access control.  
‚úÖ **Collaboration** ‚Äì Users can edit and share files in real-time.  
‚úÖ **Workflows & Automation** ‚Äì Approval processes, notifications, and event-driven actions.  
‚úÖ **Security & Compliance** ‚Äì Versioning, audit logs, and user permissions are built-in.  

But, let‚Äôs keep it real‚ÄîSharePoint isn‚Äôt great for everything.

## üö´ What SharePoint Is NOT Good For

‚ùå **High-performance transactional databases** ‚Äì It‚Äôs not a replacement for SQL Server or NoSQL databases.  
‚ùå **Real-time data processing** ‚Äì SharePoint APIs can be slow compared to dedicated solutions.  
‚ùå **Complex business logic** ‚Äì It's not a substitute for a robust backend with microservices.  
‚ùå **Building an entire app inside SharePoint** ‚Äì Just don‚Äôt. Extend it, don‚Äôt replace your actual app with it.

# üõ† Setting Up SharePoint Integration in ASP.NET 8

To get started, you‚Äôll need:

* **ASP.NET 8 application**
* **SharePoint Online (or On-Premises SharePoint Server)**
* **Microsoft Graph API or SharePoint CSOM (Client-Side Object Model)**

### üîß 1. Install Required NuGet Packages

Install the required packages in your ASP.NET 8 project:

```powershell
dotnet add package Microsoft.Graph
dotnet add package Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM
dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
```

***

### üìÇ 2. Connect to SharePoint Using Microsoft Graph API

Graph API is the recommended way to interact with SharePoint Online.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Graph;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;

var tenantId = "your-tenant-id";
var clientId = "your-client-id";
var clientSecret = "your-client-secret";

var confidentialClient = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
    .Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithAuthority($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}")
    .Build();

var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) =>
{
    var authResult = await confidentialClient.AcquireTokenForClient(new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" }).ExecuteAsync();
    requestMessage.Headers.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", authResult.AccessToken);
}));
```

***

### üìÅ 3. Upload a File to SharePoint

```csharp
var siteId = "your-site-id";
var filePath = "path-to-your-file.pdf";
var fileBytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(filePath);

using var stream = new MemoryStream(fileBytes);
await graphClient.Sites[siteId].Drive.Root.ItemWithPath("Documents/sample.pdf")
    .Content
    .Request()
    .PutAsync<DriveItem>(stream);
```

***

### üìú 4. List Files in a SharePoint Library

```csharp
var driveItems = await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Drive.Root.Children.Request().GetAsync();

foreach (var item in driveItems)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {item.Name}, ID: {item.Id}");
}
```

***

### üîÑ 5. Download a File From SharePoint

```csharp
var fileStream = await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Drive.Items["file-id"].Content.Request().GetAsync();
using var file = new FileStream("downloaded-file.pdf", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write);
await fileStream.CopyToAsync(file);
```

***

### üè∑ 6. Get File Metadata

```csharp
var file = await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Drive.Items["file-id"].Request().GetAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {file.Name}, Last Modified: {file.LastModifiedDateTime}");
```

***

### üîÑ 7. Create a SharePoint List Item

```csharp
var newItem = new ListItem
{
    Fields = new FieldValueSet
    {
        AdditionalData = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            {"Title", "New Task"},
            {"Status", "In Progress"}
        }
    }
};

await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Lists["list-id"].Items.Request().AddAsync(newItem);
```

***

### üóë 8. Delete a File in SharePoint

```csharp
await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Drive.Items["file-id"].Request().DeleteAsync();
```

***

### üîë 9. Set Permissions on a File

```csharp
var permission = new Permission
{
    Roles = new List<string> { "read" },
    GrantedTo = new IdentitySet
    {
        User = new Identity { Id = "user-id", DisplayName = "John Doe" }
    }
};

await graphClient.Sites["your-site-id"].Drive.Items["file-id"].Permissions.Request().AddAsync(permission);
```

***

### üì© 10. Send a SharePoint Notification (Webhook)

```csharp
var subscription = new Subscription
{
    ChangeType = "updated",
    NotificationUrl = "https://your-api.com/webhook",
    Resource = "sites/your-site-id/lists/list-id",
    ExpirationDateTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
    ClientState = "your-client-state"
};

await graphClient.Subscriptions.Request().AddAsync(subscription);
```

***

# üéØ Key Ideas
### Use SharePoint When:
- You need document management and versioning.
- You want to store and retrieve files with controlled access.
- You need basic collaboration tools.
- You want built-in security and compliance.

### Avoid SharePoint When:
- You need high-speed, real-time data transactions.
- You‚Äôre building complex applications that require a relational database.
- You don‚Äôt want to deal with Microsoft 365 authentication headaches.

With the right situatoin, SharePoint can add alot of value and reduce boilerplate custom code.
