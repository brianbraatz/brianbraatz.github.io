# Cult of the Dead Cow and Back Orifice: History and How It Affected Computer Security

## Who the Heck is Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)?

Back in the 1980s, while most people were busy trying to figure out how to program their VCRs, a group of hackers formed what would become one of the most influential hacker collectives of all time: **[Cult of the Dead Cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow)** (cDc). The name alone sounds like something straight out of a metal band, but these folks were no ordinary computer geeks. They were pioneers, pranksters, and some would even say, **cyber-revolutionaries**.

The cDc was known for its mix of tech expertise, political activism, and a strong dose of humor. They basically took hacking, mixed it with a bit of punk rock attitude, and made it their mission to expose security flaws that big corporations and governments would rather keep hidden.

And then, in 1998, they dropped a bombshell on the cybersecurity world: **Back Orifice**.

## Back Orifice: The OG Remote Access Tool (or RAT, if You Like Fancy Acronyms)

If you’ve ever been paranoid about someone watching you through your webcam, you can (sort of) thank cDc for that. **[Back Orifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Orifice)** was released at DEF CON 6 in 1998, and it basically allowed hackers (or "security researchers," depending on your perspective) to **remotely control Windows machines**.

### How Did Back Orifice Work?

Back Orifice was a **Remote Administration Tool (RAT)**. It let you control someone’s Windows computer over the internet **without their permission**. Here’s what it could do:

* **Keystroke Logging** – Type away, and someone else sees everything you write.
* **File Transfers** – Send and receive files like an invisible courier.
* **Process Management** – Kill tasks, start new ones, or mess with the user.
* **Remote Shell Access** – Full command-line access to the victim's machine.
* **Screen and Audio Capture** – Because why not spy on everything?

The kicker? It was **only 124KB** in size. That’s smaller than most memes today.

## Was This a Virus or a Security Tool?

Good question! If you asked cDc, they would tell you that **Back Orifice was designed to expose Microsoft's terrible security**. Windows 95 and 98 had gaping security holes, and BO was meant to **embarrass Microsoft** into fixing them.

But let’s be real: it didn’t take long before **hackers, script kiddies, and cybercriminals** started using Back Orifice for, uh… less noble purposes.

## Back Orifice 2000: The Sequel No One Asked For (But Everyone Used)

In 1999, cDc released **Back Orifice 2000 (BO2K)**, an upgraded, even more powerful version. This one had **encryption**, **plugins**, and support for **Windows NT**. It was the Swiss Army knife of remote hacking tools.

At this point, it became clear that BO2K was **no joke**. Companies started **banning it**, **antivirus vendors scrambled to detect it**, and Microsoft was forced to improve its security game.

## The Legacy: How Back Orifice Changed Cybersecurity

Back Orifice wasn’t just a tool. It was a **wake-up call**. It forced people to realize that:

* **Windows security was terrible** (seriously, Windows 98 was like Swiss cheese).
* **Remote Access Trojans (RATs) were now a thing**.
* **Hackers weren’t just criminals; they were also activists and innovators**.

Microsoft eventually improved its security posture, especially with Windows XP and later, but the idea of **Remote Access Trojans** lived on.

## Is Back Orifice Still Relevant Today?

Short answer: Not really. BO2K hasn’t been a serious threat in years. **Modern operating systems, firewalls, and antivirus software** can easily detect and block it.

Long answer: The **idea** of Back Orifice **absolutely lives on**. Modern malware, like **Remote Administration Trojans (RATs) and spyware**, still use the same tricks:

* **Tools like njRAT, DarkComet, and Remcos** are spiritual successors to BO.
* **State-sponsored hacking** has taken RATs to a whole new level.
* **Corporate spyware** (*cough* Pegasus *cough*) is basically BO2K on steroids.

So while **Back Orifice itself is a relic**, its **concept** is more relevant than ever.

## The Cult of the Dead Cow’s Other Contributions

BO wasn’t the only thing cDc did. They also:

* Created **Goolag**, a tool to expose vulnerable Google services.
* Advocated for **hacktivism**, pushing the idea that hacking could be used for **good**.
* Coined the term **"Hacktivism"**, which is now a major part of modern cybersecurity.

## Final Thoughts

The Cult of the Dead Cow didn’t just build hacking tools; they **changed the way we think about security**. They proved that **security through obscurity doesn’t work**, and sometimes, the best way to make a system secure is to **publicly break it**.

And that, my friends, is how a group of renegade hackers from the 80s made the internet a slightly safer (and infinitely more paranoid) place.
