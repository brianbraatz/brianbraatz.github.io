I've been using **Microsoft Flow** for a few years now, and it's been a good ride...

and now..

Microsoft Flow is evolving into **Power Apps**.

# How I got here- Lotus Notes saved my bacon in 2000

I started with the low-code model where I used Lotus Notes to build a full sysztem to handle a huge project I was working on .

I didnt have the time to CODE a information system to support my project - so I fell in love with Notes.

We had about 140 people all together on the project. We had a QA department and so did the customer. And it was all very complicated. We had a contract with the customer that tied customer QA- and UAT with line items in the contract.

I needed a system that was very custom to support all this. The developers code a feature- which is connected to a contract line item which is connected to the UAT approaval test- which we need to track - and revise- and all this ties back to the contact . And when we release to the customer- we give them a document showing this release and what line items in the contract where done.

I setup a low-code Lotus notes system- and setup the customer with it was well.. The could test - and edit documents in notes- which would sync with out documents in notes etc.

I would have not had the time to code such a complex system- and in the early 2000s - nothing existed that could to this.

So I built a lotus notes low-code multi-qa- contract linked - replicated information system .

Since then - i have moved into **Microsoft Flow** , and am happy about it. But my brain has had to evolve out of the Lotus mindset..

it looks like my brain needs to evolve again- with the new **Power Apps** .

It took my automation addiction to new heights. From simple workflows to complex business process automation, Flow did it all‚Äîwell, almost.

<!-- , the next evolution in Microsoft's low-code revolution. It promises to take everything Flow did well and **crank it up to 11**. So, naturally, I'm **super excited** to dig in. -->

## What is Power Apps?

Power Apps is Microsoft's **low-code application development platform**.

The goal is to help users create apps **without needing hardcore coding skills**.

### The Basic Ideas behing Power Apps:

* **Create full-fledged apps** with custom UIs, forms, and business logic.
* **Integrate seamlessly** with Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and tons of third-party services.
* **Automate workflows** just like Flow but more flexibile
* **Use AI and data analysis** in ways Flow could only dream of (But AI today vs then is a whole new thing :) )

## What Power Apps Does Better Than Flow

1. **More Than Just Automation** ‚Äì Flow was good at automation, but Power Apps lets you build **actual apps** instead of just linking different parts together.
2. **Better UI & Forms** ‚Äì You can design a full UI with Power Apps, for internal business tools and data entry apps.
3. **More Customization** ‚Äì Flow had limits on customization, but Power Apps is much more flexiable
4. **Advanced Data Handling** ‚Äì  more data sources and it looks better at transformaing and displaying data.

## What I Loved About Flow (And Still Do)

1. **Super Simple Automation** ‚Äì Flow was basically ‚Äúconnect the dots‚Äù automation, making it easy to use.
2. **Great for Quick Fixes** ‚Äì If you just needed to automate something small, Flow was perfect. No need to build an entire app.
3. **Integration King** ‚Äì Flow played well with **hundreds** of apps and services, from SharePoint to Twitter.

## What Wasn't So Great About Flow

1. **Limited UI** ‚Äì Flow was great for automation, but it couldn‚Äôt handle creating custom user interfaces.
2. **Scaling Issues** ‚Äì Some complex workflows in Flow got **messy** fast. Debugging them? ummm.. not fun....
3. **Data Handling Was Meh** ‚Äì Handling and displaying data wasn‚Äôt Flow‚Äôs strong suit. (though to be fair.. neither is my cat.. "Mittens"...)

## Power Apps vs. Flow: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Feature        | Power Apps üèÜ | Flow (Power Automate) üèóÔ∏è |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Automation** | ‚úÖ Better workflows | ‚úÖ Still solid |
| **UI Building** | ‚úÖ Full UI support | ‚ùå Nope |
| **Custom Apps** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Not really |
| **Ease of Use** | ‚ùå More complex | ‚úÖ Easier |
| **Scaling** | ‚úÖ Better for big apps | ‚ùå Can get messy |
| **Integration** | ‚úÖ Still great | ‚úÖ Still great |

## Final Verdict

Power Apps is a **huge** upgrade over Flow if you need more than just automation. It **lets you build apps, customize workflows, and handle data better** than Flow ever could.

But if you just need simple automation, **Flow (now Power Automate) still has its place**. It‚Äôs easier, faster, and great for quick workflow solutions.

In short: **Flow was great, but Power Apps is the future.**
