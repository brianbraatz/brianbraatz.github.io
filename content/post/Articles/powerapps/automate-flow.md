# Microsoft Flow in a Nutshell

I've been a die-hard **Lotus Notes** fan since around the year 2000. Yeah, I know, laugh all you want—some people collect vintage cars, I collect vintage software loyalty.

For almost two decades, Lotus Notes has been my go-to low-code solution for when i needed to build an app quickly- that could collect, managage and manipulate data from many users..

<!--
business workflows, data management, and just general "make-life-easier" automation. It wasn't perfect, but it got the job done, and it was **THE** thing back in the day.

But let's be real—Lotus Notes has been fading into the background faster than my New Year's resolutions. And then, out of nowhere, **Microsoft Flow** pops up, looking all modern and cloud-based, waving its fancy integrations in my face. So naturally, I had to check it out.

While I love Notes.. its getting a bit long in the tooth :)\
(Some would argue that so am I :)  )

## Microsoft Flow vs. Lotus Notes

### What Microsoft Flow Does Better

1. **Automation Powerhouse** – Flow connects with  of apps, from SharePoint and Outlook to Twitter and Dropbox. If it has an API, Flow can probably talk to it

2. **User-Friendly Interface** – Notes had a UI only a developer could love (and even then, barely). Flow? Click, drag, done. It's like Notes' "little-to-no-code" approach, but actually pleasant to use.

3. **Cloud-Native** – Flow runs in the cloud, syncs everywhere. For me - this is both a positive and a negative.. Some times you want to run your own server on-prem

4. Flow works on Mobile... When notes was invented smartphones didnt exist.. :)

<!-- 
4. **AI and Bots** – Flow integrates with **Power Automate**, which brings in AI-driven workflows, chatbots, and some really slick automation tricks.

5. **Better Mobile Support** – Lotus Notes on mobile? That’s like trying to run a marathon in flip-flops. Flow, on the other hand, plays nice with mobile apps and cloud platforms.

### What I Still Love About Lotus Notes

1. **Offline Capabilities** – Flow is cloud-first, which is great… until your internet dies. Notes, on the other hand, could run just fine even if the internet exploded.

2. **Deep Customization** – Notes let you do some **wild** customization. Flow is powerful but has guardrails—sometimes, I just want to go full mad scientist on my automation.

3. **Better Data Security (Sometimes)** – Since I always rean Notes on-prem, data was **really** under my  control. Flow is secure, but you have to trust the cloud.

## Final Thoughts

Times change.. things evolve..

Sometimes we need to think differently as things evolve.. So we can evolve too :)

I **love** Lotus Notes, but I can’t ignore the writing on the wall. Microsoft Flow (or Power Automate, as it’s now called) is the future.

I **love** Lotus Notes, but I can’t ignore the writing on the wall. Microsoft Flow (or Power Automate, as it’s now called) is the future. It’s **faster, more connected, easier to use, and honestly, kinda fun**. If you're still hanging onto Lotus Notes, I get it—but Flow is definitely worth checking out.

It pains me to say this, but I think Flow wins this round. RIP, Lotus Notes. You were weird, but you were mine.
