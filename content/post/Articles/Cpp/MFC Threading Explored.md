# MFC Worker Threads Explored

## A Quick History of MFC

Ah, MFCâ€”the **Microsoft Foundation Classes**.

The framework that let Windows developers in the â€˜90s write GUI applications *without* manually calling the Windows API for every single button, label, and window.

A revolution! A game-changer!

And a magnificent way to write enterprise software that nobody wants to maintain 20 years later.

Back in the ancient days of computing (a.k.a. **Windows 3.1**), life was *simple*.

We had **Win16**, which was a 16-bit, single-tasking, cooperative-multitasking environment.

You know what that means?

NO THREADS!

If you wanted to do something time-consuming, well, *tough luck*.

Your UI would freeze, users would scream, and you'd be left wondering if there was a better way.

Then came **Windows 95** and the glorious transition to **Win32**â€”an actual **preemptive multitasking** environment.

Finally, developers could create **background threads** to run long operations while keeping the UI responsive.

The problem? Not everyone knew how to use them properly, and a lot of people (like past-you) probably did it wrong a few times before getting it right.

Fast forward a bit, and we had Windows NT, Windows 2000, XP, and beyond, all of which supported **real, honest-to-goodness** multithreading.

And of course, the cool kids (like me) had to start playing around with worker threads.

## Worker Threads in MFC

Once we had Win32, it wasnâ€™t long before Microsoft introduced MFC-based threading mechanisms.

And let me tell you, *they had options*. Here are the two main types of MFC threads:

1. **Worker Threads** â€“ Background threads that perform tasks without UI interaction.
2. **UI Threads** â€“ Threads that can create and interact with Windows UI elements.

Most of the time, you'll be using **worker threads** because UI threads are a pain unless you *really* need them.

### The Ways to Create Worker Threads in MFC

There are a couple of ways to create worker threads in MFC:

### 1. Using `AfxBeginThread` (MFC Style)

MFC provides the `AfxBeginThread` function, which makes spinning up threads *almost* painless. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```cpp
UINT MyWorkerThreadFunction(LPVOID pParam) {
    // Do some time-consuming task here
    Sleep(3000);
    return 0;
}

void StartWorkerThread() {
    CWinThread* pThread = AfxBeginThread(MyWorkerThreadFunction, NULL);
}
```

#### Pros:

* Clean and easy to use.
* MFC manages cleanup automatically.
* Plays nicely with MFCâ€™s message pumping system.

#### Cons:

* Slightly more overhead than using raw Windows API threads.
* Limited control over thread creation parameters.

### 2. Using Windows API Threads (For the Hardcore Devs)

If you're feeling brave (or just want more control), you can use `CreateThread` from the Windows API:

```cpp
DWORD WINAPI MyWinAPIFunction(LPVOID lpParam) {
    Sleep(3000);
    return 0;
}

void StartWinAPIThread() {
    HANDLE hThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, MyWinAPIFunction, NULL, 0, NULL);
    if (hThread) CloseHandle(hThread);
}
```

#### Pros:

* More control over thread attributes.
* More lightweight than MFCâ€™s `AfxBeginThread`.

#### Cons:

* **YOU** are responsible for cleanup (i.e., calling `CloseHandle`).
* No MFC integration, so interacting with the UI from this thread is tricky.

### 3. Using `std::thread` (Modern C++ Style)

With modern C++, you can use `std::thread`, which is cleaner and portable:

```cpp
#include <thread>

void MyCppThreadFunction() {
    Sleep(3000);
}

void StartCppThread() {
    std::thread t(MyCppThreadFunction);
    t.detach();
}
```

#### Pros:

* Modern and portable.
* Automatic cleanup if `std::jthread` (C++20) is used.

#### Cons:

* Slightly trickier in MFC applications (you must ensure proper synchronization).

## Comparing MFC Threads vs. Windows API Threads

| Feature              | MFC `AfxBeginThread`   | Windows API `CreateThread`       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Ease of Use          | Easy                   | Harder                           |
| Cleanup              | Automatic              | Manual (must call `CloseHandle`) |
| Integration with MFC | Yes                    | No                               |
| Performance          | Slightly more overhead | More lightweight                 |
| Fine-grained control | No                     | Yes                              |

## Conclusion

If you're working in an **MFC-based** application, your best bet is to use `AfxBeginThread`.

Itâ€™s easy, clean, and integrates nicely with the rest of MFC.

If youâ€™re working on something more **low-level** or performance-sensitive, then `CreateThread` is the way to go, but just remember to clean up your mess.

And if you're **starting fresh** with modern C++, then `std::thread` is a great alternative that will work even outside of Windows.
