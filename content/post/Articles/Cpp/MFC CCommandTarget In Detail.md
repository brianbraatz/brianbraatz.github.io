# MFC CCommandTarget In Detail

## Introduction

Ah, MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes).

If you've been around C++ and Windows programming long enough, you've probably either loved it or cursed it—possibly both at the same time.

And today, we're diving into one of its most "mysterious" classes: `CCommandTarget`.

## What is CCommandTarget?

Simply put, `CCommandTarget` is a base class in MFC that provides message-handling capabilities.

If you've ever written an MFC application, there's a high chance you've been using `CCommandTarget` without even realizing it—because `CWnd` (the base class for all MFC windows) derives from it.

It's the foundation for:

* Message maps (`ON_COMMAND`, `ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI`, etc.)
* OLE automation
* ActiveX control hosting
* Inter-object communication

So basically, it’s the unsung hero of MFC that makes sure your app listens when users click buttons, select menu items, or even interact with COM objects.

## The Role of CCommandTarget in MFC

Think of `CCommandTarget` as the middle manager of your MFC app.

It doesn’t do the real work, but it makes sure the right messages get to the right places.

It enables the infamous **message maps**, which allow MFC to handle Windows messages in a clean, object-oriented manner.

### Key Features of CCommandTarget:

1. **Message Maps**: This is how MFC handles user input. Instead of dealing with raw Windows messages, you use `ON_COMMAND`, `ON_WM_PAINT`, and other macros to neatly direct messages to class methods.
2. **Dispatch Maps**: If your class needs to expose functions to OLE automation (think scripting and COM integration), this feature lets you do it.
3. **Interface Maps**: Used in conjunction with COM to expose interfaces.
4. **Serialization Support**: Allows objects to be saved and loaded easily.

## Message Maps: The Magic Behind CCommandTarget

Without `CCommandTarget`, you’d be manually processing messages using giant switch statements. Instead, MFC provides a structured way to handle UI commands with **message maps**.

Example:

```cpp
class CMyDialog : public CDialog
{
    DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()
public:
    afx_msg void OnButtonClick();
};

BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyDialog, CDialog)
    ON_BN_CLICKED(IDC_MYBUTTON, &CMyDialog::OnButtonClick)
END_MESSAGE_MAP()

void CMyDialog::OnButtonClick()
{
    AfxMessageBox(_T("Button clicked!"));
}
```

Here, `CCommandTarget` ensures that when a button is clicked, the right function (`OnButtonClick`) is called.

## OLE and COM: CCommandTarget’s Secret Superpowers

If you've worked with **OLE automation** or **ActiveX**, you’ve already used `CCommandTarget`'s dispatch and interface maps.

### Exposing Functions to OLE:

```cpp
class CMyAutomationObject : public CCmdTarget
{
    DECLARE_DYNCREATE(CMyAutomationObject)
    DECLARE_DISPATCH_MAP()

public:
    afx_msg void MyFunction();
};

BEGIN_DISPATCH_MAP(CMyAutomationObject, CCmdTarget)
    DISP_FUNCTION(CMyAutomationObject, "MyFunction", MyFunction, VT_EMPTY, VTS_NONE)
END_DISPATCH_MAP()

void CMyAutomationObject::MyFunction()
{
    AfxMessageBox(_T("Called via OLE!"));
}
```

With this setup, external programs (like VBA, Python, or even another C++ app) can call `MyFunction` via COM.

## Serialization: Making Objects Persist

`CCommandTarget` supports MFC's **serialization** mechanism, meaning you can easily save and load objects.

```cpp
class CMyData : public CObject
{
    DECLARE_SERIAL(CMyData)
public:
    CString m_strData;
    void Serialize(CArchive& ar);
};

IMPLEMENT_SERIAL(CMyData, CObject, 1)

void CMyData::Serialize(CArchive& ar)
{
    if (ar.IsStoring())
        ar << m_strData;
    else
        ar >> m_strData;
}
```

This allows `CMyData` objects to be stored and retrieved from files, databases, or even network streams.

## When to Use CCommandTarget (and When to Avoid It)

### Use `CCommandTarget` When:

* You need to handle UI commands in an MFC app.
* You're implementing OLE automation.
* You need serialization support.
* You’re building an ActiveX control.

### Avoid `CCommandTarget` When:

* You're writing non-MFC applications.
* You prefer modern C++ techniques (like `std::function` for event handling).
* You don’t need message maps or COM integration.

## Conclusion

`CCommandTarget` is like the plumbing in your house—essential but mostly invisible. It powers message handling, OLE automation, and serialization in MFC applications. While modern C++ has moved on with things like signals/slots and event-driven programming, if you're maintaining or extending an MFC application, understanding `CCommandTarget` is a must.

So the next time your MFC app does something cool, take a moment to appreciate `CCommandTarget`—the silent workhorse of MFC!
