# ASP.NET Core 2.1 vs ASP.NET Framework â€“ Key Differences and What Changed?

Ah, the eternal battle: ASP.NET Core vs.

ASP.NET Framework.

Kind of like Batman vs.

Superman, but with more semicolons and fewer capes.

If you're still clinging to the classic ASP.NET Framework like itâ€™s an old Windows XP install you refuse to format, you might be wondering: *Is the new ASP.NET Core 2.1 worth it?* Or is Microsoft just throwing another shiny toy at developers to keep us busy?

Let's break it down.

## 1.

Whatâ€™s the Big Deal About ASP.NET Core 2.1?

ASP.NET Core 2.1 is like ASP.NET Framework's cooler, faster, and much more lightweight younger sibling.

Itâ€™s cross-platform (finally!), meaning you can run your web apps on Linux, Mac, and of course, Windows.

No more Microsoft-only shackles!

### Major Features in ASP.NET Core 2.1:

* **Performance Boost** â€“ Itâ€™s fast.

Like, *really* fast.

Microsoft even brags about it being *the fastest web framework on the planet* (benchmarks pending, of course).

* **Cross-platform** â€“ Develop on Windows, run on Linux.

No more "It works on my machine!" excuses.

* **Razor Pages** â€“ A simpler way to build web UIs.

Think of it like WebForms, but not horrible.

* **Built-in Dependency Injection** â€“ No need to wire up Autofac or some other DI container.

Itâ€™s all included.

* **GDPR Support** â€“ Because we all love extra compliance requirements.
* **HTTPS by Default** â€“ No more lazy devs shipping insecure HTTP apps.

## 2.

Whatâ€™s Still Good About ASP.NET Framework?

So, should we all just throw ASP.NET Framework into a burning trash can and move on?

Not so fast!

ASP.NET Framework is still relevant for:

* **Enterprise Legacy Apps** â€“ Got a massive monolithic app running on .NET Framework?

Good luck rewriting it in Core overnight.

* **Full .NET Framework Features** â€“ Some things, like full WCF support and Windows-specific APIs, are still better in the classic framework.
* **Web Forms (lol, just kidding)** â€“ If you're still using Web Forms in 2018, I hope you enjoy suffering.
* **Mature Ecosystem** â€“ More third-party libraries and tools are still available for .NET Framework.

## 3.

Migration: Should You Make the Leap?

If you're starting a *new* project, **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is a no-brainer**.

It's fast, modern, and built for the future.

If you're maintaining an old-school ASP.NET Framework app, though, migrating to Core **might not be worth it** unless youâ€™re feeling particularly adventurous (or your boss insists on it).

Itâ€™s not always a smooth transition.

## 4.

The Verdict: Is ASP.NET Framework Dead?

Not quite.

Microsoft is still supporting ASP.NET Framework, but **ASP.NET Core is clearly the future**.

If youâ€™re just getting started with web development, dive into Core 2.1 now, and donâ€™t look back.

But if you're stuck maintaining a decade-old ASP.NET Framework app, wellâ€¦ maybe itâ€™s time to start updating that resume. ðŸ˜œ

| Topic                 | Summary                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASP.NET Core 2.1**  | Faster, cross-platform, built-in DI, Razor Pages, HTTPS by default, GDPR support |
| **ASP.NET Framework** | Still good for legacy enterprise apps and full .NET Framework support            |
| **Performance**       | Core 2.1 is much faster than ASP.NET Framework                                   |
| **Migration**         | Worth it for new projects, but tricky for large legacy apps                      |
| **Verdict**           | ASP.NET Core is the future, but ASP.NET Framework still has its place for now    |
