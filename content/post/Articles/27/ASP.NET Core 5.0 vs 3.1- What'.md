# ASP.NET Core 5.0 vs 3.1: What‚Äôs New?

Alright, developers, it‚Äôs time to answer that burning question: **Should you upgrade to ASP.NET Core 5.0, or is 3.1 still good enough?**

If you‚Äôre still using ASP.NET Core 3.1, first of all, respect!

That‚Äôs a solid LTS (Long Term Support) version.

But Microsoft dropped **ASP.NET Core 5.0**, and it brought some cool new tricks to the table.

So, let‚Äôs break it down and see what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs better, and whether you should make the leap.

***

## üöÄ What‚Äôs New in ASP.NET Core 5.0?

### 1. **No More .NET Framework Versions ‚Äì It‚Äôs Just .NET Now!**

ASP.NET Core 5.0 ditches the ".NET Core" branding and merges everything under **.NET 5**.

No more Core vs.

Framework confusion.

It‚Äôs all one big happy .NET family now.

### 2. **Performance Improvements That Will Make Your API Fly ‚úàÔ∏è**

Microsoft went all out on performance optimizations in .NET 5.0.

The Kestrel web server?

Faster.

JSON serialization?

Faster.

Garbage collection?

Faster. **Everything is just‚Ä¶ faster.**

For example, gRPC performance got a major boost, making it even more attractive for high-speed microservices.

If you‚Äôre into APIs, this is huge.

### 3. **HTTP/2 Support for gRPC Over Kestrel üî•**

Speaking of gRPC, ASP.NET Core 5.0 finally allows gRPC services to work over **HTTP/2** in Kestrel without requiring an ASP.NET Reverse Proxy.

Less hassle, more speed.

### 4. **Minimal API Improvements (Getting Ready for .NET 6)**

ASP.NET Core 5.0 laid the groundwork for **Minimal APIs**.

While the real magic happens in .NET 6, this version starts simplifying API development with fewer ceremony-heavy controllers and startup configurations.

### 5. **New Routing and Middleware Features üõ£Ô∏è**

* Endpoints now support **OpenAPI (Swagger) improvements**.
* Middleware performance got some love, making request handling even smoother.
* **Custom Routing Constraints** now make it easier to fine-tune route patterns.

### 6. **Blazor Gets Even Better üé®**

If you‚Äôre a Blazor fan (or just love writing C# instead of JavaScript), **Blazor in .NET 5** brings some major upgrades:

* **WebAssembly performance boosts** (faster loading times).
* **New CSS Isolation**, so you can finally stop battling global styles.
* **Improved JavaScript interop**, because sometimes you still need JS.

### 7. **Single-File Applications Are a Thing Now üì¶**

ASP.NET Core 5.0 introduces **single-file executables**, meaning you can package your whole app into a single `.exe` file.

Deployment just got way easier.

No more dealing with a million DLLs.

## üîÑ What‚Äôs Improved from ASP.NET Core 3.1?

| Feature                | ASP.NET Core 3.1 üèõÔ∏è  | ASP.NET Core 5.0 üöÄ                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| .NET Branding          | .NET Core 3.1         | Just .NET (no Core)                      |
| Performance            | Good                  | **Way better** (faster APIs, gRPC, JSON) |
| gRPC Support           | HTTP/1.1 proxy needed | Native HTTP/2 support in Kestrel         |
| Middleware Performance | Decent                | Optimized for speed                      |
| Blazor Features        | Strong                | **Better WebAssembly + CSS Isolation**   |
| Routing Improvements   | Basic                 | **More flexible custom constraints**     |
| Deployment Options     | Multi-file            | **Single-file apps available**           |

***

## ü§î Should You Upgrade?

If you‚Äôre running **ASP.NET Core 3.1** in production, **you‚Äôre fine for now** since it's an LTS release (supported until 2022).

But if you‚Äôre starting a **new project**, then **go with ASP.NET Core 5.0** for that sweet performance boost and future-proofing.

Plus, **.NET 6 is the next LTS**, so you‚Äôll want to be ready for that upgrade.

***

## üéØ Final Thoughts

ASP.NET Core 5.0 isn‚Äôt **just a minor update**‚Äîit‚Äôs Microsoft laying the foundation for a faster, more efficient .NET ecosystem.

If you love speed, better APIs, and simpler deployments, **5.0 is calling your name**.

And if you‚Äôre still on ASP.NET Core 3.1?

No rush‚Äîbut start planning for that move to .NET 6.

Happy coding! üöÄ
