## Node.js 10 - Worker Threads in a Nutshell

So, you‚Äôve heard about **Worker Threads** in Node.js 10 and wondered, \*‚ÄúWait, isn‚Äôt Node.js single-threaded?

What is this sorcery?‚Äù\* Well, my friend, let‚Äôs crack open this **multithreaded** nutshell and see what‚Äôs inside.

***

### Why Worker Threads?

Node.js is fantastic for **I/O-heavy applications**, thanks to its event-driven, non-blocking architecture.

But when it comes to **CPU-intensive tasks**, like processing large files, number crunching, or running AI models, things get a little‚Ä¶ *sticky*.

The single-threaded event loop gets **blocked**, and your server starts acting like a sluggish sloth.

That‚Äôs where **Worker Threads** come in!

### What Are Worker Threads?

Before Node.js 10, if you wanted to leverage multiple cores, you had to spawn **child processes** or use **clustering**.

But these approaches had some downsides:

* **Child processes** don‚Äôt share memory, so they need inter-process communication (IPC), which adds overhead.

* **Clusters** duplicate the entire process, consuming more resources.

Worker Threads, introduced in Node.js 10, allow **true multithreading** inside a single process.

They share memory through **SharedArrayBuffer** and can **communicate efficiently** via message passing.

### How to Use Worker Threads

Using Worker Threads is actually super easy.

Let‚Äôs start with a basic example.

#### Step 1: Import the `worker_threads` Module

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
```

#### Step 2: Create a Worker

If you‚Äôre in the **main thread**, you can create a worker like this:

```javascript
if (isMainThread) {
    const worker = new Worker(__filename);
    worker.on('message', msg => console.log(`Worker says: ${msg}`));
    worker.postMessage('Hello from main thread!');
} else {
    parentPort.on('message', msg => {
        console.log(`Main thread says: ${msg}`);
        parentPort.postMessage('Hello from worker thread!');
    });
}
```

#### Step 3: Run It!

When you run this file with `node script.js`, you‚Äôll see the two threads chatting with each other.

Congrats, you just wrote a multithreaded Node.js app!

### When to Use Worker Threads

You don‚Äôt always need Worker Threads.

Here‚Äôs when they **make sense**:

‚úÖ CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., large data processing, cryptography, image processing)\
‚úÖ Background tasks that shouldn‚Äôt block the event loop\
‚úÖ Offloading work from the main thread while keeping everything in a single process

And here‚Äôs when you **don‚Äôt need them**:

‚ùå Simple I/O-bound tasks (e.g., database queries, file reading) ‚Äì just use async/await\
‚ùå When running too many workers can consume too much memory

***

### Basic Ideas

* **Worker Threads** allow true multithreading in Node.js 10 and later.

* They are great for **CPU-intensive** tasks but unnecessary for **I/O-bound** tasks.

* Unlike child processes, they can **share memory**, reducing overhead.

* Use `worker_threads` module to create workers and communicate via messages.

* If your app is slowing down due to CPU-bound work, **Worker Threads can save the day!** ü¶∏

## Key Ideas

| Concept             | Explanation                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Worker Threads      | A new feature in Node.js 10 that enables multithreading.        |
| Shared Memory       | Workers can share memory via SharedArrayBuffer.                 |
| Message Passing     | Workers communicate with the main thread using messages.        |
| CPU-Intensive Tasks | Best use case for Worker Threads to offload heavy computations. |
| I/O-Bound Work      | Should still be handled with async/non-blocking methods.        |
