<!-- ## Understanding Node.js Electron Connection

Alright, buckle up, because weâ€™re about to dive deep into the magical world where Node.js and Electron hold hands and make desktop apps happen.

Youâ€™ve probably heard of Node.js running servers, but did you know itâ€™s also the secret sauce behind apps like Obsidian and Visual Studio Code?

Letâ€™s break it down, in the most casual way possible.

--- -->

### Node.js: The Unstoppable JavaScript Engine

So, what even is Node.js?

If youâ€™ve been living under a rock, hereâ€™s the deal: Node.js is JavaScript on steroids, running outside the browser.

Think of it as JavaScript escaping the cage of the browser and deciding it wants to be a full-fledged backend powerhouse.

And itâ€™s not just for web serversâ€”oh no, it does **way** more than that!

#### Node.js as a Server

Yeah, Node.js is famous for running servers.

Itâ€™s like the friendly neighborhood pizza guy delivering JSON data instead of pepperoni pizzas.

Thanks to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, it can handle a **ton** of requests at once without breaking a sweat.

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s the backbone of so many modern web applications.

But what if I told you that Node.js isnâ€™t just some backend-only tech?

Enter **Electron**.

***

### What is Electron?

A Desktop Revolution

Electron is like that one person in a group project who does everything.

It lets you build full-fledged desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And guess what powers it?

**Node.js!**

#### How Electron Uses Node.js

Electron combines the Chromium browser with Node.js, making it possible to write desktop apps with the same JavaScript code youâ€™d use for a website.

Itâ€™s like running a mini web app, but instead of being trapped in Chrome, it gets its own window like a *real* application.

Your desktop app in Electron actually consists of two key parts:

1.

**Main Process** â€“ Runs in Node.js and controls things like menus, system dialogs, and file access.

2.

**Renderer Process** â€“ Runs in Chromium and takes care of displaying the UI, just like a web browser.

Thanks to this duo, Electron apps can do things normal web apps canâ€™t, like accessing the file system, running background processes, and communicating with the OS.

*Fancy!*

***

### Node.js and Electron in Obsidian and VS Code

Now, letâ€™s talk about **two** of the biggest Electron-based apps: **Obsidian** and **Visual Studio Code**.

#### Obsidian: A Markdown Loverâ€™s Paradise

If youâ€™re here, you probably love **Markdown** (because this article is written in itâ€”*meta!*).

Obsidian is a Markdown-based knowledge management tool, and guess what?

It runs on **Electron**, meaning itâ€™s a full-fledged Node.js app wrapped in a desktop UI.

Obsidian takes advantage of Node.js to:

* Read and write files directly to your local storage (no need for an internet connection!).

* Use plugins, many of which tap into Node.js features.

* Keep your vault running smoothly without relying on a remote server.

So, every time you open Obsidian and write notes, youâ€™re basically interacting with a JavaScript-powered desktop app.

Cool, right?

#### Visual Studio Code: The Editor That Runs Everything

VS Code is **THE** code editor of choice for a lot of developers, andâ€”surprise, surpriseâ€”itâ€™s also built using **Electron**.

That means every time you open VS Code, youâ€™re basically running a **mini web app** on your desktop thatâ€™s powered by Node.js.

VS Code makes heavy use of Node.js for:

* Running the integrated terminal (which is just a shell interface powered by Node.js).

* Managing extensions, many of which hook into Node.js functionalities.

* Background processing and file system operations.

So yeah, even your beloved code editor is secretly just a giant JavaScript app pretending to be a desktop application.

### Wrapping Up: Node.js is Everywhere

To sum it all up:

* **Node.js isnâ€™t just for servers**; itâ€™s the backbone of many desktop applications thanks to Electron.

* **Electron lets you build desktop apps** using web technologies, with Node.js running behind the scenes.

* **Obsidian and VS Code** are prime examples of Node.js-powered desktop apps you probably use daily.

Basically, if you love JavaScript, Node.js will keep showing up in your life whether youâ€™re building web servers, desktop apps, or something in between.

<!-- 
Now go forth and appreciate Node.js in all its glory! -->
