# What's New in ASP.NET Core 7: A Casual Dive into the Latest Features

Hey there, fellow code wranglers! ðŸŽ‰ ASP.NET Core 7 has just dropped, and it's packed with goodies that'll make your developer heart sing.

Let's take a laid-back stroll through the coolest new features, shall we?
-->

## Servers and Runtime: Speed and Control, Baby!

* **Rate Limiting**: Ever had that one friend who just won't stop texting?

Now you can set boundariesâ€”at least with your server.

Limit request rates with flexible endpoint configurations and policies.

No more server overwhelm! [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/rate-limiting)

* **Output Caching**: Remember that time you memorized all the answers for trivia night?

This is like that but for your server responses.

Cache 'em and serve 'em up hot and fast. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output)

* **Request Decompression**: Got incoming requests all zipped up?

No worries.

ASP.NET Core 7 can now handle compressed content straight outta the box. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/performance/request-decompression)

* **HTTP/3 Support**: Faster, more reliable connections?

Yes, please!

Say hello to built-in HTTP/3 support, riding on the shiny new QUIC protocol. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/http3)

* **WebSockets over HTTP/2**: WebSockets are cool.

HTTP/2 is cool.

Together?

Super cool.

Now you can run WebSockets over HTTP/2 connections. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets)

* **WebTransport (Experimental)**: Think of it as WebSockets' cooler cousin.

Create streams and datagrams over HTTP/3.

It's experimental, so tread lightly! [Learn more](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3)

## Minimal APIs: Less Code, More Power

* **Endpoint Filters**: Ever wish you could run some code before or after your route handlers without the hassle?

Now you can with endpoint filters.

It's like having a bouncer for your endpoints. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/filters)

* **Typed Results**: Strongly typed results in minimal APIs?

You betcha!

Keep things neat and type-safe. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/typed-results)

* **Route Groups**: Organize your endpoints like a pro with route groups.

Group 'em up with a common prefix and keep your codebase tidy. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis)

## gRPC: Now with Extra JSON Flavor

* **JSON Transcoding**: Expand your gRPC services' horizons by exposing them as JSON-based APIs.

It's like giving them a second language. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/json-transcoding)

* **OpenAPI with JSON Transcoding (Experimental)**: Generate OpenAPI specs for your gRPC JSON transcoded services.

It's experimental, so handle with care! [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/json-transcoding#openapi-support)

* **gRPC Health Checks**: Keep an eye on your gRPC server apps' health with built-in health checks.

Because nobody likes unexpected downtime. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/health-checks)

* **gRPC Client `AddCallCredentials`**: Need to send authorized requests?

Now your gRPC clients can use bearer tokens with ease. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/authn-and-authz#client)

## SignalR: Better Communication, Happier Apps

* **Client Results**: Ever wanted your clients to send results back to the server in response to server requests?

Now they can!

It's like having a two-way street for your data. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/streaming)

## MVC: Nullable Awesomeness

* **Nullable View and Page Models**: Embrace the null!

Now your view and page models support nullable reference types, making null state checking a breeze. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation)

## Blazor: Web Development, Evolved

* **Custom Elements**: Build standard HTML custom elements with Blazor and integrate them into any JavaScript-based app.

It's like having your cake and eating it too. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/custom-elements)

* **Handle Location Changing Events**: Intercept location changes to create custom navigation experiences.

Because who doesn't like a personalized touch? [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/routing)

* **Bind After/Get/Set Modifiers**: Run async logic after data binding and control how data binding gets and sets data.

More control, less hassle. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/data-binding)

## Performance Improvements: Faster Than Ever

* **HTTP/2 Performance Boosts**: Kestrel's been hitting the gym.

Expect reduced CPU usage and higher throughput for HTTP/2 requests. [Learn more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-preview-4/)

* **gRPC JSON Transcoding Performance**: Serialize those messages faster and with less memory.

Your app just got a turbo boost. [Learn more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-preview-7/)
