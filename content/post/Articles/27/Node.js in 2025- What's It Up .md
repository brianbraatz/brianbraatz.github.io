Ah, Node.js.

Remember when it was the new kid on the block, shaking up the server-side scene?

Fast forward to 2025, and it's not just the cool kid anymore—it's practically running the neighborhood BBQ.

So, what's Node.js up to these days? -->

<!-- Let's dive into its latest shenanigans. -->

<!-- 
## The Usual Suspects: What Node.js Is Handling in 2025

1. **Real-Time Applications**: Node.js is the go-to for apps that need to be as quick as your coffee order in the morning. Think chat apps, online gaming, and live streaming. Its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture make it the Usain Bolt of data processing.

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Monolithic apps? So last decade. In 2025, Node.js is the backbone for microservices, letting developers break down big, clunky applications into sleek, manageable services. This means easier updates and scaling—like upgrading your burger to a double without overhauling the whole menu.

3. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: From smart fridges that tell you when you're out of milk to wearables that nag you to stand up, Node.js is the silent partner in IoT. Its lightweight footprint and ability to handle multiple connections make it perfect for managing all your smart doodads.

4. **Serverless Computing**: Why bother managing servers when you can go serverless? Node.js is a favorite in this arena, allowing developers to deploy functions without the server babysitting. It's like ordering takeout instead of cooking—convenient and time-saving. -->
