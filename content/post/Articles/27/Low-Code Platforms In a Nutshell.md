# Low-Code Platforms: A No-Nonsense Guide to the Best Free, Paid, and Self-Hosted Options in 2023
-->

## A Brief History of Low-Code

Once upon a time (somewhere between the 1980s and 2000s), developers looked at lines and lines of code and thought, ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶ less?‚Äù

The first low-code concepts started as visual programming tools.

Think early drag-and-drop environments like Visual Basic.

By the 2010s, businesses realized that they could save time and money if non-developers (a.k.a. "citizens" in the realm of citizen development) could build applications with minimal coding.

Fast forward to today, and low-code/no-code platforms are running the show.

Developers love them because they take care of the repetitive stuff.

Businesses love them because they don‚Äôt have to hire expensive programmers for every little app.

And citizen developers?

They love the power trip of building things without having to write a single semicolon.

## Free, Paid, and Self-Hosted Low-Code Platforms

Low-code tools come in all shapes and sizes.

Some are free, some cost as much as a used car, and some can be self-hosted for those who prefer to have control over their infrastructure.

Let's break it down.

### üÜì Best Free Low-Code Platforms

If you‚Äôre broke but still want to build cool stuff, here are some great free options:

* **Budibase** ‚Äì Open-source and self-hostable.

Great for internal tools and dashboards.

* **Appsmith** ‚Äì Another open-source platform that supports backend integrations and APIs.
* **Google AppSheet** ‚Äì Free for personal use and surprisingly powerful for automating simple workflows.
* **OutSystems (Free Tier)** ‚Äì Limited, but decent for learning the ropes.
* **Mendix (Community Edition)** ‚Äì Great for small projects but with usage restrictions.

### üí∞ Best Paid Low-Code Platforms (Worth Your Money)

If you‚Äôve got some cash to burn and want premium features, these platforms are top-notch:

* **OutSystems** ‚Äì Enterprise-grade low-code with AI-driven automation.

Expensive, but powerful.

* **Mendix** ‚Äì Popular for large enterprises and has excellent collaboration tools.
* **Microsoft Power Apps** ‚Äì Integrates well with Microsoft products, making it ideal for businesses already in the ecosystem.
* **Retool** ‚Äì Loved by developers who need rapid internal tool development.
* **ServiceNow App Engine** ‚Äì Great for IT service automation, but not cheap.

### üè† Self-Hosted Low-Code Platforms (For Control Freaks)

If you don‚Äôt trust the cloud or just want to keep things private, these self-hosted platforms are your best bet:

* **Budibase** ‚Äì Completely free and open-source.

Host it on your own servers.

* **Appsmith** ‚Äì Another solid open-source option that lets you deploy on-premise.
* **N8n** ‚Äì More workflow automation than traditional low-code, but a great self-hosted alternative to Zapier.
* **Joget DX** ‚Äì A low-code/no-code hybrid that‚Äôs popular in enterprises.
* **Directus** ‚Äì More of a headless CMS with low-code features, but self-hostable.

## Cloud vs.

Self-Hosted: Which One Should You Choose?

| Feature         | Cloud-Based Platforms | Self-Hosted Platforms                |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Setup Time**  | Instant               | You need to install and configure    |
| **Maintenance** | Handled by provider   | You do it yourself                   |
| **Security**    | Provider-controlled   | You control everything               |
| **Scalability** | Automatic             | Depends on your infrastructure       |
| **Cost**        | Subscription-based    | Can be cheaper (but requires effort) |

If you just want to build things quickly and don‚Äôt mind paying for convenience, **cloud-based low-code** platforms are the way to go.

If you‚Äôre paranoid about security, need full control, or just enjoy making life harder for yourself, **self-hosted low-code** is your best bet.

## Conclusion

Low-code development has come a long way, and in 2023, there‚Äôs something for everyone‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a budget-conscious builder, an enterprise innovator, or a control-obsessed engineer.

The key is knowing **what you need**.

If you want the fastest setup, go for a cloud-based solution.

If you value privacy and control, self-hosting is the way to go.

Either way, coding (or, well, *not* coding) has never been this fun.
