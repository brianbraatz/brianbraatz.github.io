# 8 Unusual Things You COULD Do with Infrastructure as Code

<!-- 
## Introduction

You know Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is great for spinning up AWS servers, managing Kubernetes clusters, and making DevOps people look like wizards. But did you know it can also do some **pretty weird and wild things**? That’s right—IaC isn’t just about deploying boring ol’ cloud infrastructure. It can be used in **unexpected, hilarious, and even borderline ridiculous ways**. 🎩✨

In this article, we’re going to cover:
- A brief **history of IaC** (because nerd cred is important)
- **10 bizarre things** you can do with it
- Some code samples (because why not?)

Buckle up, it’s about to get weird. 🚀

## A Quick History of Infrastructure as Code

Before IaC, deploying infrastructure was like assembling IKEA furniture **without instructions**. Sysadmins manually configured everything, leading to errors, inconsistencies, and existential dread. 😵‍💫

Then, in the 2010s, tools like **AWS CloudFormation (2011)** and **Terraform (2014)** changed everything. Suddenly, you could define your entire infrastructure **in code**, store it in Git, and deploy it automatically. No more clicking around AWS like a lost intern.

***

### 1. **Deploy a Minecraft Server** 🎮

Why manually set up a Minecraft server when **Terraform** can do it for you? With IaC, you can spin up a dedicated EC2 instance, configure networking, and deploy Minecraft—all in a few lines of code.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "minecraft_server" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  user_data     = "#!/bin/bash\nsudo yum install -y java\nsudo wget -O /home/ec2-user/minecraft_server.jar https://minecraft.net/latest.jar"
}
```

### 2. **Schedule Happy Hour Reminders in Slack** 🍻

Using **Ansible**, you can automate sending Slack reminders every Friday at 4 PM.

```yaml
- name: Happy Hour Reminder
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Send Slack Message
      community.general.slack:
        token: "{{ slack_token }}"
        msg: "It's Friday! Time for a beer 🍺"
```

### 3. **Automate Cat Picture Delivery** 🐱

You can use **AWS Lambda and Terraform** to set up a pipeline that fetches a random cat picture from an API and posts it to your Twitter every day. Because why not?

### 4. **Turn Your Lights On/Off with Terraform** 💡

Home automation? With **Pulumi**, you can control your smart home devices via AWS IoT. A single config change can **turn your lights on and off**.

### 5. **Create a Server That Self-Destructs** 💥

Want to deploy a self-destructing AWS EC2 instance? Just use an **auto-terminating Terraform script** that deletes itself after 10 minutes. Great for security testing!

### 6. **Track Your Plant’s Watering Schedule** 🌱

Using **IoT + IaC**, you can automate plant watering reminders or even integrate with a smart irrigation system.

### 7. **Spin Up a Fake Company Website for Fun** 🏢

Ever wanted to prank your coworkers? Use **CloudFormation** to deploy a static S3-hosted website for a fake company with official-looking branding.

### 8. **Automate Your Resume Deployment** 📄

Some developers **host their resumes on AWS S3** and use **IaC to update it dynamically** when they make Git commits. Smart move for job seekers!

## Conclusion

Who said **Infrastructure as Code** had to be boring? Sure, IaC is great for managing cloud infrastructure, but as we’ve seen, it can also do **some truly ridiculous and fun things**.

So the next time someone tells you that Terraform and Ansible are just for AWS deployments, tell them you’re using IaC to control your lights, send Slack messages, and run a Tinder bot. 😆

Now go forth and automate some weird stuff! 🚀
