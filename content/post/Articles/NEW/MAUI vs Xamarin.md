# MAUI vs Xamarin – The Ultimate Showdown

Ah, Xamarin. The OG of .NET cross-platform development. If Xamarin was a car, it’d be that reliable old sedan that still runs fine but has a cassette player. Then along comes .NET MAUI, the sleek electric vehicle that Microsoft is betting the future on. 

So, what’s the deal? Should you ditch Xamarin like an expired milk carton and move to MAUI? Let’s break it down.

---

## 🧐 What Even Are These Things?

### **Xamarin – The Veteran**

Xamarin was Microsoft's way of letting C# developers build mobile apps for iOS and Android **without** learning Swift, Kotlin, or sacrificing their sanity.

It provided a way to share most of the codebase while still letting you write platform-specific tweaks. It even had **Xamarin.Forms**, which let you build UIs that (mostly) worked across platforms.

But, let’s be honest: Xamarin.Forms sometimes felt like a duct-taped solution. It worked… but not always smoothly.

### **MAUI – The New Kid on the Block**

MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is basically **Xamarin.Forms 2.0 on steroids**.

Microsoft took everything Xamarin.Forms did, gave it a protein shake, hit the gym, and came back stronger.

MAUI isn’t just for mobile—it lets you build for **iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac** with a **single codebase**. The dream, right?

## 🔥 Key Differences

| Feature                 | Xamarin                       | MAUI                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Supported Platforms** | iOS, Android, (Mac, kinda)    | iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS                |
| **UI Framework**        | Xamarin.Forms                 | MAUI (built-in, improved)                   |
| **Project Structure**   | Separate iOS/Android projects | Single project (because who loves clutter?) |
| **Performance**         | Good, but not great           | Faster and more optimized                   |
| **Native APIs**         | Requires dependency services  | Easier with platform-specific handlers      |
| **Community Support**   | Decent, but aging             | Growing rapidly                             |

## 🚀 What MAUI Does Better

1. **Single Project Structure**\
   Xamarin had **separate** projects for iOS and Android, which meant juggling files like a circus act. MAUI simplifies this with a **single project**, making life easier.

2. **Performance Boosts**\
   With **.NET 6/7 and ahead**, MAUI ditches Xamarin’s old baggage and **runs smoother, faster, and cleaner**.

3. **Better UI Customization**\
   MAUI’s **Handlers** replace Xamarin’s **Renderers**, making it **way easier to tweak native controls**.

4. **Desktop Support**\
   Xamarin kinda supported Mac, but **MAUI actually** supports Windows and macOS **properly**.

## 😰 Should You Migrate?

If you’re already **neck-deep in a Xamarin project**, migrating might feel like **moving houses mid-lease**. But here’s the thing:

* **New projects?** Go MAUI. No brainer.
* **Existing projects?** Stick to Xamarin for now, but plan for MAUI, since **Microsoft is phasing out Xamarin in May 2024**.

Yep, Xamarin is **going the way of Internet Explorer**. If you don’t migrate, future-you might be **stuck maintaining a fossil**.

***

## 🤔 Key Ideas

* **Xamarin is like your reliable old car**—it’s been great, but its days are numbered.
* **MAUI is the future**, and Microsoft is all in.

So if you’re starting fresh, **go MAUI**. If you’re on Xamarin, **start thinking about migration before it’s too late**.
