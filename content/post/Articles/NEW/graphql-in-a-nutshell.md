# GraphQL In a Nutshell

## What is GraphQL? A Short, Sweet, and Possibly Over-Caffeinated Introduction

Once upon a time (okay, in 2012), a team of engineers at Facebook had a problem: their mobile apps were **slower than a turtle stuck in peanut butter**.

The reason? Their REST APIs were fetching way more data than necessary.

So, they put their heads together and said, *"What if we could just ask for exactly what we need?"*

Boom. **GraphQL** was born. It was publicly released in **2015**, and since then, it has taken over the API world like a cat video goes viral on the internet.

## Microservices Applications

Today, a common development pattern is **decomposing applications into independent microservices**, which communicate via APIs. As the number of microservices in the environment increases, GraphQL offers various benefits:

* **Efficient request routing**: GraphQL helps optimize how requests are distributed across microservices.
* **Graceful error handling**: Queries can fail **partially** while still returning useful data.
* **Parallel request execution**: A single GraphQL query can fetch data from multiple microservices **in parallel**.

Instead of multiple endpoints, **GraphQL consolidates all API requests into one** and routes them internally, making API interactions **simpler** and **faster**.

## GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

GraphQL has a **Schema Definition Language (SDL)** that defines the structure of your API. The schema describes **types**, **queries**, **mutations**, and **subscriptions**, making it easy to understand what data is available.

Here’s an example:

```graphql
type User { 
  id: ID! 
  name: String! 
  email: String! 
  friends: [User] 
} 

type Query { 
  user(id: ID!): User 
  allUsers: [User] 
} 

type Mutation { 
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User 
}
```

### Type System

The root type of a GraphQL schema is usually `Query`, and it contains **all the available fields** that can be queried. Other types define objects and fields that the GraphQL server can return.

#### Scalars & Lists

GraphQL has **scalar types** like:

* `String`
* `Int`
* `Float`
* `Boolean`
* `ID` (used for unique identifiers)

By default, fields are **nullable**, meaning they can return `null`. If you want a field to be **non-nullable**, use an **exclamation mark (`!`)**.

```graphql
type Book { 
  title: String!  # Required field 
  author: String  # Nullable field 
  genres: [String]  # List of strings 
}
```

## Rapid Application Prototyping

When prototyping new applications, **speed is everything**. GraphQL improves development productivity by:

* Allowing **frontend teams to work independently** from backend teams.
* Acting as a **wrapper around existing APIs**, adding features like **authentication** and **authorization**.
* Reducing the need for **backend modifications** just to accommodate frontend changes.

This makes **GraphQL a common choice for startups**, where development speed is crucial.

## GraphQL vs REST

REST endpoints often return **too much** or **too little** data. **GraphQL lets the client** decide exactly **what data is needed**.

### Example: REST vs GraphQL

* **REST API Calls**:
  1. `/users` → Returns a list of users.
  2. `/users/{id}/comments` → Returns comments for a user.
  3. `/comments/{id}/details` → Returns details for a comment.

* **GraphQL Query**:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    name
    comments {
      content
      details {
        timestamp
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* **Result:** **One** request instead of **three**.

## GraphQL Resolvers

Resolvers handle **fetching data** for fields. They execute **only when needed**, making them powerful for **lazy-loading data**.

```typescript
@Resolver(() => Movie)
export class MovieResolver {
    constructor(private movieCommentService: MovieCommentService) {}

    @ResolveField('movieComment', () => [MovieComment])
    async getMovieComment(@Parent() movie: Movie) {
        return this.movieCommentService.getAllMovieCommetsByMovieId(movie.id);
    }
}
```

Resolvers **reduce database load** and **prevent unnecessary queries**.

## Global Object Identification

GraphQL provides **Global Object Identification** to enable **consistent caching and object lookups**. This ensures that GraphQL clients can efficiently **store and refetch objects**.

### How It Works

For this system to work, GraphQL requires a **standardized way** of querying and retrieving objects via **unique identifiers**.

Example query:

```graphql
{
  node(id: "4") {
    id
    ... on User {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Node Interface

The `Node` interface ensures every object can be **retrieved by a unique ID**:

```graphql
# An object with a Globally Unique ID
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

type User implements Node {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

* The `id` field ensures that objects **can be uniquely identified** and refetched.
* A **node query** allows fetching **any object by its ID**, ensuring **easy caching**.

### Introspection for Nodes

A GraphQL server implementing `Node` correctly will allow introspection queries like this:

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "Node") {
    name
    kind
    fields {
      name
      type {
        kind
        ofType {
          name
          kind
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "__type": {
    "name": "Node",
    "kind": "INTERFACE",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": {
          "kind": "NON_NULL",
          "ofType": {
            "name": "ID",
            "kind": "SCALAR"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Stability in Object Identification

If two objects have **identical IDs**, they must be **equal** in every field.

Example:

```graphql
{
  fourNode: node(id: "4") {
    id
    ... on User {
      name
      userWithIdOneGreater {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
  fiveNode: node(id: "5") {
    id
    ... on User {
      name
      userWithIdOneLess {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "fourNode": {
    "id": "4",
    "name": "Mark Zuckerberg",
    "userWithIdOneGreater": {
      "id": "5",
      "name": "Chris Hughes"
    }
  },
  "fiveNode": {
    "id": "5",
    "name": "Chris Hughes",
    "userWithIdOneLess": {
      "id": "4",
      "name": "Mark Zuckerberg"
    }
  }
}
```

Since `fourNode.id` and `fiveNode.userWithIdOneLess.id` are the **same**, their **names must also match**.

### Plural Identifying Root Fields

GraphQL supports **plural root fields** to fetch **multiple objects at once**.

Example:

```graphql
{
  usernames(usernames: ["zuck", "moskov"]) {
    id
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "usernames": [
    { "id": "4" },
    { "id": "6" }
  ]
}
```

* The **order** of responses must match the **order of requests**.
* This ensures **efficient bulk-fetching**.

### Global Object Identification helps

* **Standardize object lookups** across all GraphQL implementations.
* **Enable caching & refetching** via a unique `id`.
* **Improve performance** when dealing with multiple related objects.

## GraphQL Best Practices

### 1. Ensure Naming Consistency in the Schema

* Use **camelCase** for fields and **PascalCase** for types.
* Consistent naming makes **queries easier to read**.

### 2. Consider Future Modifications to the Schema

* GraphQL schemas **will evolve**. Design with **extensibility** in mind.
* Avoid **breaking changes** that require **remapping** everything.

### 3. Eliminate Illogical Fragments

* Fragments **should be meaningful** and **simplify queries**, not **complicate them**.
* **Avoid unnecessary** or **redundant** fragments.

### 4. Avoid Hard-Coded Arguments

* Use **variables**, not **hard-coded parameters**.
* Hard-coding **exposes sensitive data** and **hurts caching performance**.

### 5. Establish an Error Handling Plan

* Expect **failure scenarios** and handle them **gracefully**.
* **Error messages should be informative** so debugging is easier.
