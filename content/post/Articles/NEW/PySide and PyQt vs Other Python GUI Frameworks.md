## How PySide and PyQt Compare to Other Frameworks

### **Tkinter: The Built-in Choice**

Tkinter comes **pre-installed** with Python and is great for **simple desktop applications**. It has a basic widget set but lacks the **modern look and feel** of Qt-based frameworks.

**Use Tkinter if:**

* You want a quick and easy way to build simple GUIs.
* You donâ€™t need advanced UI elements.
* You prefer a lightweight solution.

### **Kivy: The Mobile-Friendly Framework**

Kivy is focused on touch interfaces and is great for **mobile and multi-touch applications**. However, it has a **steeper learning curve** and is not ideal for traditional desktop applications.

**Use Kivy if:**

* You need to build a cross-platform mobile app.
* You want to use multi-touch gestures.
* You donâ€™t mind a non-native look.

### **wxPython: The Native Look-and-Feel Option**

wxPython is another solid option that provides **native-looking** applications across platforms. Itâ€™s a bit less popular than PyQt/PySide but can be a great choice for **lightweight applications**.

**Use wxPython if:**

* You need an app that looks and feels native on each OS.
* You prefer a simpler licensing model than PyQt.

## Side By Side

| **Library**  | **Pros**                                                                                  | **Cons**                                                        | **Best For**                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Tkinter**  | - Built-in with Python  <br>- Simple to use  <br>- Lightweight                            | - Basic UI elements  <br>- Outdated look  <br>- Limited styling | Small, simple applications & beginners      |
| **PyQt**     | - Feature-rich  <br>- Professional look  <br>- Cross-platform  <br>- Strong documentation | - Learning curve  <br>- GPL/commercial license issues           | Complex applications, professional software |
| **PySide**   | - Similar to PyQt but LGPL license  <br>- Feature-rich                                    | - Less community support than PyQt                              | Alternative to PyQt with LGPL licensing     |
| **Kivy**     | - Supports mobile and touch-based UIs  <br>- Modern look                                  | - Not native-looking on desktop  <br>- Can be tricky to style   | Mobile apps, multi-touch interfaces         |
| **wxPython** | - Native look & feel  <br>- Cross-platform  <br>- Good documentation                      | - API complexity  <br>- Not as widely used as PyQt/PySide       | Desktop applications needing native UI      |

<!-- 
Each library has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of projects. If you're making a quick prototype, PySimpleGUI is great. If you need a full-fledged, modern UI, PyQt or PySide are excellent choices. For mobile or touch-based apps, Kivy is the way to go.

## Conclusion
PyQt and PySide are **powerful choices** for GUI development, offering the **richest** feature set among Python GUI frameworks. However, if you need something simple, **Tkinter** is a great starting point. If you're targeting **mobile**, **Kivy** is the way to go, and if you want a **native desktop look**, **wxPython** is worth considering.

No matter what you choose, Python has **great GUI options** for every type of project. Now go build something awesome! ðŸš€

-->

## PySide and PyQt Compared

**HAHAH!! can you spot the differences?**\*\*

### PyQt Code Sample

```python
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel, QWidget
import sys

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = QWidget()
window.setWindowTitle("PyQt Example")
label = QLabel("Hello, PyQt!", parent=window)
window.show()
sys.exit(app.exec())
```

### PySide Code Sample

```python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel, QWidget
import sys

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = QWidget()
window.setWindowTitle("PySide Example")
label = QLabel("Hello, PySide!", parent=window)
window.show()
sys.exit(app.exec())
```

## How PySide and PyQt Compare to Other Frameworks

### **Tkinter: The Built-in Choice**

Tkinter comes **pre-installed** with Python and is gear to **simple desktop applications**.

It has a basic widget set but lacks the modern look and feel of Qt-based frameworks.

**Use Tkinter if:**

* You want a quick and easy way to build simple GUIs.
* You donâ€™t need advanced UI elements.
* You prefer a lightweight solution.

#### Tkinter Code Sample

```python
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Tkinter Example")
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()
root.mainloop()
```

### **Kivy: The Mobile-Friendly Framework**

Kivy is focused on touch interfaces.  ala iPhone and Android.\
However, humans on the interwebs seem to complain it has a steeper learning curve .

**Use Kivy if:**

* You need to build a cross-platform mobile app.
* You want to use multi-touch gestures.
* You donâ€™t mind a non-native look.

#### Kivy Code Sample

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Label(text="Hello, Kivy!")

MyApp().run()
```

### **wxPython: The Native Look-and-Feel Option**

wxPython is another solid option that provides **native-looking** applications across platforms. Itâ€™s a bit less popular than PyQt/PySide but can be a great choice for **lightweight applications**.

**Use wxPython if:**

* You need an app that looks and feels native on each OS.
* You prefer a simpler licensing model than PyQt.

#### wxPython Code Sample

```python
import wx

app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="wxPython Example")
panel = wx.Panel(frame)
text = wx.StaticText(panel, label="Hello, wxPython!", pos=(10,10))
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()
```

Yes, you **can** use **PyQt** for an internal application within your company **without selling it**, but there's a licensing detail you need to be aware of:

## The confusing Licensing situation with PyQt and Pyside

### **PyQt Licensing**

* **PyQt is dual-licensed**:

- \***GPL (General Public License)** â€“ **Free**, but you must **open-source** your code if you distribute the app outside your company.
- . **Commercial License** â€“ Required if you want to keep your code **proprietary** and distribute it outside your company.

### **PySide Licensing**

* **PySide is licensed under LGPL (Lesser General Public License)**.
* This means you can use it **for free**, even in **commercial and closed-source applications**, as long as you **dynamically link** against the Qt libraries.
* Unlike PyQt (which has a GPL license that requires you to open-source your code unless you buy a license), PySide allows proprietary software **without needing a commercial license**.

### **When Might You Need a Commercial License for Qt?**

1. If you **statically link** Qt instead of dynamically linking it (LGPL requires dynamic linking).
2. If you use certain **Qt commercial-only modules** (e.g., some enterprise features).
3. If you want **official support** from The Qt Company
