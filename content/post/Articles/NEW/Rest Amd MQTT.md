# REST and MQTT: The Dynamic Duo of Microservice APIs

Ever feel like your microservices are like cats—aloof, independent, and occasionally knocking things over?&#x20;

Well, let's talk about two protocols that can help herd those cats: **REST** and **MQTT**. Inspired by Dejan Glozic's article, ["REST and MQTT: Yin and Yang of Micro-Service APIs"](https://dejanglozic.com/2014/05/06/rest-and-mqtt-yin-and-yang-of-micro-service-apis/).

## REST: The Reliable Messenger

REST (Representational State Transfer) is like that dependable friend who always shows up on time.&#x20;

It's a synchronous request-response protocol where clients ask for information, and servers provide it.&#x20;

Great for straightforward interactions, but when data changes frequently, clients might end up constantly asking, "Are we there yet?"—leading to inefficiencies.

## MQTT: The Chatty Companion

Enter MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), the chatty friend who keeps you updated on every little thing.&#x20;

It's a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol ideal for scenarios where devices need to send real-time updates.&#x20;

Instead of clients polling for data, MQTT allows servers to push updates to clients as they happen. No more incessant "Are we there yet?" questions; you'll know the moment you arrive.

## Combining REST and MQTT: Best of Both Worlds

Why choose between your reliable and chatty friends when you can have both? Combining REST and MQTT can create a robust microservice architecture:

1. **Baseline with REST**: Clients make initial REST requests to get the current state of data.
2. **Real-Time Updates with MQTT**: Servers publish updates via MQTT to keep clients informed of changes.
3. **Fallback to REST**: If a client misses an update (maybe it was grabbing a coffee?), it can make another REST request to get back on track.

This approach ensures clients have the latest data without constant polling, reducing system load and latency.

## Comparisons Between MQTT, WebSockets, and SignalR

MQTT, WebSockets, and SignalR all serve different purposes but can sometimes overlap in real-time communication scenarios. Here’s a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses:

| Protocol       | Pros                                                                        | Cons                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MQTT**       | Lightweight; optimized for low bandwidth; excellent for IoT devices         | Requires broker; not ideal for browser-based applications                         |
| **WebSockets** | Full-duplex communication; ideal for browser-based applications             | Higher overhead than MQTT; not optimized for extremely low-bandwidth environments |
| **SignalR**    | Built-in support for .NET applications; automatic reconnection and fallback | More complex than WebSockets; heavier dependencies                                |

## REST vs. MQTT vs. WebSockets vs. SignalR

| Feature                | REST                            | MQTT                      | WebSockets                   | SignalR                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Communication Type** | Request-Response                | Publish-Subscribe         | Full-Duplex                  | Full-Duplex               |
| **Connection Type**    | Stateless                       | Persistent                | Persistent                   | Persistent                |
| **Best For**           | Simple API interactions         | IoT and real-time updates | Interactive web applications | .NET-based real-time apps |
| **Latency**            | Higher (polling required)       | Low                       | Very Low                     | Very Low                  |
| **Bandwidth Usage**    | High (due to repeated requests) | Low                       | Moderate                     | Moderate                  |

## Pros and Cons

| Approach      | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST Only** | Simple implementation; stateless                             | Inefficient for frequent updates; higher latency      |
| **MQTT Only** | Real-time updates; low bandwidth                             | Requires persistent connections; more complex setup   |
| **Combined**  | Efficient data retrieval; real-time updates; reduced polling | Increased complexity; requires managing two protocols |

## Wrapping Up

By blending the strengths of REST and MQTT, you can design microservice APIs that are both reliable and responsive.&#x20;

It's like having the best of both worlds—just like combining peanut butter and jelly or binge-watching sci-fi and fantasy.

## Key Takeaways

* **REST**: Synchronous, request-response protocol ideal for initial data retrieval.
* **MQTT**: Asynchronous, publish-subscribe protocol perfect for real-time updates.
* **Combined Approach**: Leverages the strengths of both protocols to create efficient and responsive microservice APIs.
