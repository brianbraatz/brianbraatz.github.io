# From C++ 1.0 to C++ 11

Ah, C++. The language that has been confusing and empowering developers since 1983. If you've ever felt the pain of debugging a memory leak at 3 AM or stared at template errors that look like encrypted alien messages, then this trip down memory lane is for you. Let's look at how we got from C++ 1.0 to C++ 11 and why each version mattered.

## The Birth of C++: C++ 1.0 (1985)

Back in the days when programmers wrote code on stone tablets (okay, maybe just on mainframes), **Bjarne Stroustrup** decided that C needed a bit more pizzazz. Inspired by **Simula**, he wanted a language that supported **object-oriented programming** while keeping C’s performance.

And thus, **C with Classes** was born, which eventually became **C++ 1.0** in 1985. It introduced:

* **Classes and Objects** – Because writing everything in `struct` was getting old.
* **Constructors & Destructors** – Automated cleanup before garbage collection was cool.
* **Operator Overloading** – Because `+` and `-` shouldn't just be for numbers.

**NO TEMPLATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    Animal(const std::string& name) : name(name) {}
    void speak() { std::cout << "I am " << name << std::endl; }
private:
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    Animal cat("Whiskers");
    cat.speak(); // I am Whiskers
    return 0;
}
```

C++ 1.0 was cool, but it was just the beginning...

## C++ 2.0 (1989) – The One with Multiple Inheritance

By 1989, programmers realized that one base class wasn't enough. We needed **Multiple Inheritance** – because why not make diamond problems a thing?

New Features:

* **Multiple Inheritance** – Why inherit from one class when you can inherit from many?
* **Abstract Classes & Pure Virtual Functions** – Interfaces, but not quite.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Mammal {
public:
    void breathe() { std::cout << "Breathing..." << std::endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal, public Mammal {
public:
    void makeSound() override { std::cout << "Woof!" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;
    myDog.makeSound(); // Woof!
    myDog.breathe();   // Breathing...
    return 0;
}
```

## C++ 98 (1998) – The Standardization Era

A decade later, developers wanted **a standard**. Enter **C++ 98**, the first **ISO standardized C++**. The goal? Make C++ reliable, predictable, and slightly less chaotic.

Big Features:

* **STL (Standard Template Library)** – Because we needed `vector` instead of raw arrays.
* **Exceptions** – Now you could throw errors instead of just suffering through them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    for (int n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## C++ 03 (2003) – The Fixer Update

Think of C++ 03 as **C++ 98.1**. It fixed annoying edge cases, like how `vector<bool>` was behaving weirdly. Nothing major happened here, just bug fixes and some quality-of-life improvements.

## C++ 11 (2011) – The Big Modernization

After years of minor updates, **C++ 11** came in like a wrecking ball. It was the biggest change since C++ 1.0, introducing **modern C++** with powerful new features.

### The Game-Changing Features:

* **Auto Keyword** – Less typing, more magic.
* **Range-Based For Loops** – No more `for(int i=0; i<vec.size(); i++)` nonsense.
* **Lambda Expressions** – Anonymous functions FTW.
* **Smart Pointers** – `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` to prevent memory leaks.
* **Move Semantics** – Because copying is expensive.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};

    // Range-based for loop
    for (auto n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

With C++ 11, the language became **safer, faster, and easier to use**. It set the stage for **modern C++** and led the way for further versions like **C++ 14, C++ 17, and beyond**.
