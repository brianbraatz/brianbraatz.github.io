# Why I Love the SQLite Database Engine

https://www.sqlite.org/

Hey there, fellow tech enthusiast! Let's dive into the world of SQLite, the little database engine that could—and does, with style!

**What's SQLite, Anyway?**

Imagine a database engine that's as light as your favorite snack but packs a punch like a heavyweight champ. That's SQLite for you! It's a free, open-source, serverless relational database engine that's self-contained and requires zero configuration. No server, no hassle—just you and your data having a good time.

**A Brief Stroll Down SQLite Lane**

Back in the spring of 2000, a brilliant chap named D. Richard Hipp was working on a U.S. Navy project for General Dynamics. He needed a lightweight, reliable database that didn't come with the baggage of a separate server process.

So, like any genius would, he created SQLite as a Tcl extension. The first version made its debut in August 2000, and since then, it's been the life of the party in countless applications and devices. Talk about a glow-up!

**Low Ceremony? More Like No Ceremony!**

SQLite is the ultimate low-ceremony engine. Being serverless, it kicks configuration, management, and maintenance to the curb. This means you can integrate a robust database engine into your applications with minimal effort. It's like adding hot sauce to your meal—simple, effective, and makes everything better.

**Perfect for Quick Projects and Unit Tests**

Need to get a project off the ground faster than a rocket? SQLite's got your back.

Its lightweight nature makes it perfect for rapid prototyping.

Plus, when it comes to unit tests, it's a developer's best friend.

No external dependencies, no fuss—just straightforward testing goodness.

**My Love for SQLite**\
I LOVE the low ceremony part about this engine.. its my go-to favorite for unit tests.. no db engine to install

And its fast enough, i usually just create the schema from scratch and throw in my sample data.

The nice thing about this- is if you are making schema changes- you can very quickly iterate.. Much faster than I could with other engines..

**SQLite: The Unsung Hero of Your Smartphone**

Most people (are engineers people?) don't know that SQLite is included in the standard SDKs for both Android and iOS.

Its the underlying data store for most mobile (iPhone-Android) apps.

Whether it's saving your high scores, storing your favorite cat memes, or keeping track of your to-do list,

SQLite is working behind the scenes.

So, next time you're swiping through an app, give a little nod to SQLite—it's probably in there, making things tick.

**But Wait, It's Not All Sunshine and Rainbows**

While SQLite is a superstar in many areas, it's not designed for high-concurrency, multi-user scenarios.

Its locking mechanism allows multiple readers but only one writer at a time.

So, if your application needs simultaneous write operations from multiple users, you might want to call in the big guns like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.

**Syntax Showdown: SQLite vs. The Rest**

Let's see how SQLite stacks up against Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL in a syntax face-off:

| Operation        | SQLite                                                    | Microsoft SQL Server                                                   | MySQL                                                                       | PostgreSQL                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create Table** | `CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);` | `CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY, name NVARCHAR(50));` | `CREATE TABLE users (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));` | `CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));` |
| **Insert Data**  | `INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');`              | `INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');`                           | `INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');`                                | `INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');`                    |
| **Select Data**  | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                    | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                                 | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                                      | `SELECT * FROM users;`                                          |
| **Update Data**  | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`             | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                          | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                               | `UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;`                   |
| **Delete Data**  | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                         | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                                      | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                                           | `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`                               |

**Feature Face-Off: SQLite vs. The Big Players**

And here's how the features compare:

| Feature                 | SQLite               | Microsoft SQL Server | MySQL         | PostgreSQL    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Server Architecture** | Serverless, embedded | Client-server        | Client-server | Client-server |
| **Concurrency Control** | Single-writer        |                      |               |               |
